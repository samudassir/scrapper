2017-11-18T16:27-08:00[America/Los_Angeles],Welcome to the Worried About Cancer Forum. This is the forum to post in if you may be worried that you have cancer. If you have posted elsewhere and find that your post is moved here it is because you can only post in a specific cancer forum if you or a loved one have a diagnosis. First a word about Cancer forums. Our mission is to provide support to people with cancer and their loved ones. We do this through our shared experiences in our journeys following cancer diagnosis. Most of us came here after our diagnosis very few have stayed after posting to this forum. That is a ray of hope for all of you. We do not diagnose cancer as we simply cannot do that. Therefore the only advice you will get is to follow up with your doctor. You can ask a few questions regarding the diagnostic process as we have all been through that but you must avoid posting continually asking questions we cannot answer. If that happens your thread will be closed. Having your thread closed does not mean you are being punished. It also does not mean we are angry with you. It only means that we have done all we can for you and we are simply trying to help you from being overwhelmed with anxiety. If at a future date you do end up with a cancer diagnosis then you can start a new thread in the specific forum for your cancer. The other thing to avoid is googling your symptoms on the 'net. Doing so will only increase your anxiety as google always points to the worst possible outcomes. Never mistake your random readings on the internet with the doctors medical degree for that is the way to anxiety and can alienate your doctor. Have faith that the doctor knows what he or she is doing and if that faith is lacking then seek a second opinion. Please avoid getting angry at moderators if they close your thread down. We are all volunteers here and we are doing what we feel is in your best interests. Ranting at moderators is against our policy and if you do this you could be banned without notice. We understand that you are worried about your future. We have all been there and know how this feels but please be patient and let the doctors do the diagnosing and try to distract yourself as best you can while testing is ongoing. Very few cancers are a medical emergency so you do have time in other words do not panic! Please read our policies before posting and also read the stuck threads on this forum especially the ones that may apply to you. These contain important information you should be aware of. The link to our core policies is below and you should read it before posting.  Thank you from the Cancer Forums team!https://www.cancerforums.net/announcement.php?f=56,null,Kermica
2014-06-06T14:54-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],This sticky is intended to provide information to U.S. residents without health insurance. The information in it is up to date as of December 16 2017.  The window for enrolling in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) ended 12/15/17 in most states. The following states have extended deadlines: CA 1/31/18 CO 1/12/18 CT 12/22/17 DC 1/31/18 MA 1/23/18 MN 1/14/18 NY 1/31/18 RI 12/31/17 WA 1/15/18Disclaimer: Please note that I am not a medical professional nor an insurance professional so all of the advice below is just based on reading experience & making phone calls. We frequently see posters here in the "Worried" forum who are uninsured and hope to get a diagnosis or reassurance from the forum or from the internet generally. Unfortunately the internet doesn't work as a diagnostic tool. An actual physical examination by a qualified person of your own personal body is the only way to find out what's going on! Options for being seen by a medical professional are listed below. Be aware that you are facing three possible levels of expense.First level Physical exam. Just going in to be seen is financially feasible for most people and may even be free in some cases. There may be lab fees for blood and urine tests or these may also be free. At this level though you could be spending hundreds of dollars.Second level Tests and scans. These may include needle biopsies biopsies CT scans and/or MRIs. At this level you're looking at thousands of dollars. However some scans may be free in some states or communities.Third level Actual diagnosis with cancer. If you are diagnosed your treatment may include surgery chemotherapy radiation... the list goes on. Here you will certainly be looking at tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Here are the First Level options which will of course vary greatly according to where you live.Free cancer screenings. Depending on where you live free cancer screenings may be available for high risk individuals. Most often these are breast cancer and colon cancer screenings. Information about this is often posted in public libraries and county social services departments.Free clinics. These are most common in cities and in socially-conscious smaller towns. They are generally staffed by volunteers. The quality of care is (in my experience) highly variable. You may wait a long time to be treated. Some of these clinics may be able to refer you to specialists who will see you on a pro bono (free) basis but this not common and is usually reserved for the neediest cases.Sliding scale facilities. These facilities will often see you on a sliding scale based on income and the scale slides all the way down to zero. The sliding scale applies to tests that can be done at the clinic but not to scans or tests for which you have to be sent elsewhere.Community health clinics. These are sometimes affiliated with a hospital. In my experience the quality is dicey. Planned Parenthood. If you are female and have symptoms related to the reproductive system or the pelvic area you can be seen here. In my experience the quality of care is usually very good.Least expensive full-price options. Dentists. If you have oral symptoms you might try visiting a dentist. Some (not all) are used to being paid by the patient so their fees tend to be lower than those of medical facilities. Ask about the fee when you make the appointment.Optometrists. They are not medical doctors but they are qualified to examine symptoms you may have that are related to the eye.Urgent Care Clinics. These places often found in strip malls or city shopping districts are often private businesses. In my experience the quality of these places is high. I recently paid $130 to be seen at one of these less than I would have had to pay at the community health clinic (since I didn't qualify for the sliding scale). I had to wait about an hour to see a physician's assistant.Mexico. Tijuana has some English-speaking doctors who will see US patients sometimes on a walk-in basis. This option may be convenient if you live near the border but not otherwise.The Most Expensive OptionEmergency Room Care. Emergency rooms are not permitted to turn away uninsured patients. However these facilities are extremely expensive. Sometimes it may be possible to set up a monthly payment plan.Bottom Line All of the above options address the first or early second level of care and will work only in a situation where your fears turn out to be completely groundless... that is a situation where you go to see a medical professional are given a couple tests maybe a scan are told you're just fine and are sent on your merry way. If you have an ongoing health problem which has been undiagnosed for some time then you're likely to be looking at lots of tests lots of specialists lots of bills. You need to get insurance. You need to get it ASAP.Insurance you can get right now.Medicaid. If you are below the poverty line in most states you are eligible for Medicaid which is completely free. Ask at your county social services department or visit your state's department of health website. In some states-- most notably Texas-- only the extremely poor qualify for Medicaid.Subsidized health insurance or full-priced insurance. Certain qualifying events (marriage divorce losing employer-provided insurance becoming a legal US resident moving to a new state or coverage area having a birthday and thus becoming too old to be included on your parents' plan) may make you eligible to buy subsidized or full-priced health insurance through the government exchanges even though you've missed the annual enrollment period. Consult your state's department of health website.  You can find your state's website via the federal website healthcare.gov. Insurance available outside the government marketplace. It looks to me just from surfing the web like you can still buy insurance through insurance agents or other non-government programs. For example my attempt to get a quote for the CostCo plan (not available in all states) didn't run into any hitches.  If all that's available right now is an expensive plan know that you'll only need it for a few months. Once the government health insurance marketplace reopens in November you can look for something else.Insurance you can apply for on November 1 2017 to take effect January 1 2018.Subsidized health insurance. This is available for those with incomes less than four times the poverty level. There are many different plans and levels of coverage.Full-price insurance. This is available for those with incomes greater than four times the poverty level. There are many different plans and levels of coverage. Both of the above will be available through your state's website. Whether you buy subsidized or full-priced insurance if you're still having ongoing health problems come November I would strongly advise you to buy a plan with low or no deductible that covers many different kinds of care. You may be looking at a long process of multiple tests scans and visits to specialists and you want to pay as little out-of-pocket as possible. Be very picky in making your insurance choice. I would advise doing all of the following: 1. Read carefully to understand what is and isn't covered. If you don't understand call the company and ask. 2. Look up to see if your preferred doctor or hospital is covered by the plan. 3. Make sure the best hospital in your region is covered by the plan. 4. Make a test phone call to the insurance company. See how long it takes you to get an actual human and how helpful that human is. Don't skip this step. This is really important. I learned the hard way. If you are in the US illegally see post #5 below.I will update this sticky as I get more information and/or as the situation changes. Please do not use this forum or any forum as a substitute for diagnosis by qualified professionals! If you think you may have cancer you can't afford to mess around.,null,GBMsibling
2014-08-05T13:12-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],When you select a health insurance plan pay attention to the following four things:Deductible The deductible is the amount you have to pay each year before the insurance kicks in. In general the cheaper the plan the higher the deductible. For example: if a plan has a $3000 deductible that means the insurance covers nothing until your medical bills for the year go over $3000. (You have to pay the first $3000 of bills.)Co-Pay The co-pay is the amount you have to pay for an appointment or treatment after the deductible is paid. For example if your co-pay is $20 for a doctor's visit that means that before the deductible is fulfilled you pay the full price of a doctor's visit. After the deductible is fulfilled you pay $20. Covered Treatments These are listed on the description of the plan. If you're not sure ask. Covered Doctors and Facilities Check before you buy! Make sure the insurance plan covers your doctor if you have one the hospital nearest your home the best hospital in your region and if necessary the best cancer center in your region. Here's an example of how it works. Let's look at two hypothetical insurance plans which we'll call plan 1 and plan 2: Plan 1: Has a monthly premium (cost) of $200 a month a deductible of $6000 and a co-pay of $35. Covers Hospital A but not Hospital B. Plan 2: Has a monthly premium of $500 a month a deductible of $500 and a co-pay of $20. Covers Hospital A and Hospital B. Say you have Plan 1 and are suddenly rushed to the ER at Hospital A. They give you a scan and a few tests admit you for observation overnight give you some drugs and you leave with a bill for $8000. The first $6000 is going to be paid by you. The rest you'll pay the co-pay for each treatment. If you're rushed to Hospital A again a week later you'll pay only the co-pay for each treatment nothing more. However if you're rushed to Hospital B which is not covered you'll pay everything. If you have Plan 2 you will pay the first $500 of your medical bills the first time you're rushed to Hospital A or Hospital B and after that you'll pay the co-pay.  If you're young and in good health Plan 1 may be the way to go. If you're in the midst of diagnosis or if you have cancer Plan 2 is better. You'll be paying $3600 a year more in premiums but your deductible will be $5500 less so you'll come out ahead.  It's important to read through the covered treatments to see what is excluded. If something is excluded that you think you might need (or know you will need) don't buy that plan. It's also important to find out what doctors and facilities in your area are covered. It can be a nasty shock to sign up for an insurance plan pay your bills and then discover that the hospital where you need to be seen isn't in the plan. Before you buy visit the insurer's website and call their help center. If it takes half an hour to get a real live person on the phone do not buy the plan no matter how good it looks.Bronze Silver Gold or Platinum: This doesn't tell you everything you need to know. If you buy through your state's health insurance website you will find that the plans are ranked as Bronze Silver Gold or Platinum. For the most part this has to do with the deductible and the co-pay. However you still need to read the fine print check the company's website and call them on the phone.  I didn't! And here's what happened. I bought a Platinum Plan from Brand New Company. No deductible $10 co-pay sounds great. Then I found out that Brand New Company's plan was not accepted by any of the doctors in my area. Also Brand New Company wouldn't cover any bills at certain facilities that didn't share their religious beliefs. I had to call Brand New Company on the phone to find all this out and each call involved being on hold for half an hour and then talking to someone who couldn't answer my questions. I also had to call them several times because they "lost" the checks I sent although my bank said they were cashing them. Bah. Fortunately there were still a few days left in the enrollment period. I went back to my state's health insurance website. I looked at the plans much much more carefully. I visited the company websites of each of the plans I was considering. I made test phone-calls just to see how long it took to get a human and how knowledgeable the human was. I ended up buying a Gold Plan not a Platinum Plan. The Gold Plan actually costs more than the Platinum Plan I had before but it's from Old Established Inc. I have had none of the problems listed above with Old Established.  So the moral to my story is: check everything out first rather than suffer later.,null,GBMsibling
2014-08-05T15:48-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Limiting the choice of doctors in the plan is part of the strategy the ACA insurance providers are using to boost profits/contain costs. They can negotiate lower rates from the few doctors in the plan and the doctors are assured of more patients.,BRCA2 3398del5 Dec 2010 - back/abd pain May 2011 - Unresectable stage III 2.5cm tumor Jun-Aug 2011 - Gem/Cis 9 rounds Oct-Nov 2011 - Radiation+Xeloda 25 days in 5 weeks Oct 2011-Sep 2012 - shrinking tumor Feb 2012 - National Familial Pancreatic Study Aug 2012 - Downgraded to stage IIA PGP Sep 2012 - Whipple T3N0M0 0.5cm tumor 0/16 lymph nodes Dec 2012 - Quebec PanCan Study Sep 2012-May 2018 - NED Mar 2013-present - NCT01088789 @pancanology,ddessert
2016-07-26T17:53-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],In addition to the information below all of the states will allow you to purchase insurance outside the enrollment period if you have a qualifying life event. These usually include moving to the state losing your job getting married or divorced being released from prison getting adopted turning 26 or becoming a US citizen. Other options outside the enrollment period:California under their Covered California program will assess individual circumstances to decide if you can purchase insurance outside the regular enrollment period.New York State has a new program The Essential Plan for which you can enroll at any time. (You don't have to wait till November.) Maximum income is $23540 for a single person and about $8000 more for each family member-- so maximum income is $48500 for a family of four. The program costs $0 to $20 a month and has no deductible.Texas provides a list of insurers who will sell insurance outside of the state government website and thus presumably outside the open enrollment period.,null,GBMsibling
2017-09-27T13:57-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],The health care law makes no provision for insuring the estimated 10 to 12 million US residents who are in the US illegally. You are not eligible for Medicaid or for the subsidized or unsubidized plans sold through the state department of health websites.  The only exception to this is California which has requested permission from the Federal government to include illegal immigrants in its health insurance plan.  Depending on where you live you may be able to purchase insurance through other means. If you are in the US illegally most of the options for "First level" care that I listed in the first post above are available to you. If you are actually diagnosed with cancer and do not have insurance the most viable option may be returning to your home country for treatment if that is possible.,null,GBMsibling
2015-07-08T19:09-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I don't have cancer. I joined CancerForums several years ago as a caregiver. For the last two months I've been having tests and scans and waiting for appointments with one specialist or another. Yesterday the doctor looked at me and said "Everything looks great. There's no evidence of malignancy." He sounded surprised. That was my first realization that he'd been pretty sure I had cancer. I was relieved but I hadn't been particularly worried. Whenever I started to worry I reminded myself of what we always tell people in the "Worried" forum. You don't have cancer until a doctor tells you you have cancer.  Of course things could have turned out differently. But even if they had I wouldn't have changed the outcome by worrying.  And of course the doctor also said things that I can now parse to death at my leisure. Things like "I'm not an expert at reading MRIs" and "You'll want to tell your PCP to check up on this every year." But I don't think I'll bother trying to suss out a meaning that wasn't there. I'm certainly not going to start worrying at this point. And for a third "of course" in my two months of bouncing around hospitals and clinics I encountered many people more deserving of my compassion than myself. So to everyone who's found their way here to the "Worried" forum-- good luck. I hope things turn out for you like they did for me. It's very likely they will. Make sure you get everything checked out that needs to be checked out. But while you're in the process of doing that do yourself a huge favor and don't worry.,null,GBMsibling
2015-07-08T19:19-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Really well said GBMsibling really well said. I am very glad to know that you have a clean bill of health that is great! Thanks for this. I will only add that even though I do have cancer I have learned how to not worry. If you live with the disease long enough (I am seven years on at this point) you learn to take things one day at a time and to accept that what will be will be. Life is too short for all of us no matter how long we live so it is best to simply relax and enjoy the ride no matter where it takes us. It is a lesson learned from a few wonderful people on this Forum who have passed on but who were simply amazing in their ability to enjoy life right to the end. I aspire to be like them.

May 2018 - did not qualify for clinical trials at Dana Farber. Tumors need to get larger to be considered. On consultation w/Dr. Armand at DF and my onc have decided to take a break from cancer treatments. Will have a biopsy of the mass in my sinus discovered in scan at DF and to get the aneurysm repaired as it has developed a potentially catastrophic penetrating ulcer.

2015-07-08T19:44-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Sib I echo what wise Kermica has said and also relieved that your results ruled out a cancer diagnosis.  When we are affected by cancer with a loved one when we have a scare of our own it seems to become easy to jump to thoughts of cancer but with that said by doing so we miss out on the beautiful everyday things life has to offer. I guess that's in our nature. I hope this thread so eloquently written will be found by many coming here to this supportive community and provide them with strength and ease for their worries.  Thank you for sharing with us. Lisa,http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/28375-my-mom,lisa1962

2015-07-09T20:45-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Very well said. I was only a caregiver and can't imagine the stress people go through before diagnosis - Rio was a bit of an odd case in that he really wasn't scared or concerned at all. Until the last possible moment he really believed there was an answer for everything that wasn't cancer. I love his optimism. I think it can go either way and I am the same as you - for some reason now that Rio has gone through it (with me pestering him the whole way lol!) I have stopped worrying about cancer all the time. Forums like this have made me see how prevalent health anxiety seems to be and the advent of the internet certainly doesn't help. A few months ago I was having some odd symptoms and my doctor sent me to see specialists (at the hospital that houses the cancer centre Rio was treated at so I was going solo - Rio can't stand the sight of the place) and I didn't realize my GP was concerned about malignancy until I thought to ask (after my mom asked me).

2014-02-26T12:50-08:00[America/Los_Angeles],We can't tell you whether you have a brain tumor. Only a doctor can tell you that and he or she can do so only after looking at a scan of your brain.  CT scans are usually given first. A brain tumor will appear as a "lesion" on a CT scan. An MRI scan will then be ordered to determine if the lesion is a tumor. Even if it is note that most brain tumors are not cancerous. It's not unusual for brain tumors to initially be misdiagnosed as something else. This is why a scan is important. However if you have already had a CT scan and no lesion appeared on it then you do not have a brain tumor. It is not necessary to go and get another CT scan and it is not wise. CT scans emit radiation. If you have what you believe are brain tumor symptoms and you have been trying without success to get your doctor to order a scan your best bet may be to present yourself as an emergency case at an emergency room/A&E department preferably at a large teaching hospital. Symptoms The Mayo Clinic website has a list of brain tumor symptoms: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-tumor/symptoms-causes/syc-20350084 Please note that having one of these symptoms or two or even all of them does not mean you have a brain tumor. It does not even mean that a brain tumor is the most likely explanation. Brain tumors are rare. Members of Cancer Forums who were diagnosed with brain cancer were in most cases diagnosed after one of the following:  * a seizure * the loss of the ability to do something such as read speak or move an arm * a severe persistent headache in one part of the head which grew worse with time  However many people have seizures without having tumors. A stroke injury or other illness can cause the loss of ability to speak read or move. And headaches have many different causes.Headaches The vast majority of headaches have nothing to do with brain tumors. (And most brain tumors do not cause headaches. Note that the brain itself cannot feel pain.) Some common causes of severe persistent headaches are: * allergies-- It does not matter if you never had allergies before. It's still much more likely you have allergies than a brain tumor. * sinus pain-- The frontal sinuses are located above the eyes. Pain there or in the sphenoid or ethmoid sinuses may seem like pain "in the brain". *bruxism-- Toothgrinding and jawclenching can cause pain in the temple area and higher up on the side of the head. If you tend to wake up with this kind of pain bruxism may be the cause. *migraines—Migraines are severe pulsating headaches of long duration.  Other causes of headaches. However do not assume that your headache is caused by any of these things without consulting a doctor.Anxiety Everyone experiences anxiety at some point in his or her life. Anxiety produces physical symptoms. Many people who come here believing they have brain tumors mention a tingling sensation muscle twitching or numbness.  These are not symptoms of a brain tumor. But they are common symptoms of anxiety. People commonly overestimate their own risk of having something rare (such as a brain tumor) and underestimate the likelihood that it is something common like anxiety or sinus pain. They are are much better at judging the risks correctly for other people.,null,GBMsibling
2014-01-09T21:42-08:00[America/Los_Angeles],This site is for cancer patients their family members and their caregivers. We are not a help diagnose me forum. We all know that being informed about our own health is a good thing. Being active in monitoring our health is an important component of staying well. However signs of health anxiety (hypochondria) can include obsessive worrying about your health or being consumed by the idea that something is seriously wrong even though your doctor has performed appropriate testing and given assurance that you are OK. Why is using Dr. Google not helpful? If you start to search for ailments by using the internet you will certainly find something that matches your symptoms. Easy access to information about every symptom or health concern that you experience can fuel your anxiety and all lead to cancer eventually. Using internet forums to seek a diagnosis or reassurance just keeps the symptoms in your head and often makes you feel worse. There is even a name for the excessive use of internet health forums which can fuel health anxiety "Cyberchondria". For more information about health anxiety visit: Mayo Clinichttp://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-c...n/con-20028314 National Health Service (NHS) UKhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hypocho...roduction.aspxhttp://www.nhs.uk/conditions/medical...atisation.aspx And here is an excellent online resource to help you manage the condition:http://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/reso...cfm?Info_ID=53 Should you or anyone else ever be diagnosed with a cancer we will be here and we will be welcoming. In the meantime what you need to do is see your physician. Your doctor can help where we cannot. If you feel unsure of the correctness of your physician's guidance gather up your medical records including lab reports physicians' reports radiologists' reports copies of xrays/scans etc and get a second opinion from another doctor.  Here are a couple of links to health anxiety forums which may be of help to you.http://anxietyforum.net/forum/forum.php?http://www.patient.co.uk/forums/disc...y-disorders-70 Good luck to you.,Tarceva hints in this thread.

If you are writing to say that you are worried because you have symptoms related to Pancreatic Cancer but you haven't been to a doctor yet here is a summary of what we are probably going to say to you: * Don't panic! * Consulting Google will only increase your fears. Dr. Google can convince people that they are seriously ill when mostly they are not. * You probably don't have Pancreatic Cancer. There are hundreds of things that can cause symptoms similar to PC but most are not in fact PC! * Unfortunately we cannot tell you that you definitely do NOT have PC either. We are not doctors and the ONLY way that PC can be diagnosed is with a biopsy of an affected area. What we can tell you is that you are obviously concerned so you should seek medical counsel for your own peace of mind.  * In summary if you are concerned go see a doctor. If you are not satisfied with how they treat you see another one. You are the greatest advocate for your own health as you have the greatest stake in it. * If you have been to a doctor who suspects Pancreatic Cancer or have the discovery of a condition that may be pre-cancerous or cancerous (ie: pancreatic cysts) and you are currently undergoing tests specifically for Pancreatic Cancer we will support you through diagnosis. However if a doctor tells you that you do NOT have PC please refrain from posting your fears on this site as there is nothing else we can do to help you. This has proven to be upsetting to our members who are currently battling PC or have loved ones who are. Debbie,March 21 2011 - Dad diagnosed. Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma on head of pancreas.

Most patients can be diagnosed on the basis of a careful history and physical examination. Localized adenopathy should prompt a search for an adjacent precipitating lesion and an examination of other nodal areas to rule out generalized lymphadenopathy. In general lymph nodes greater than 1 cm in diameter are considered to be abnormal. Supraclavicular nodes are the most worrisome for malignancy. A three- to four-week period of observation is prudent in patients with localized nodes and a benign clinical picture. Generalized adenopathy should always prompt further clinical investigation. When a node biopsy is indicated excisional biopsy of the most abnormal node will best enable the pathologist to determine a diagnosis. The cause of lymphadenopathy is often obvious: for example the child who presents with a sore throat tender cervical nodes and a positive rapid strep test or the patient who presents with an infection of the hand and axillary lymphadenopathy. In other cases the diagnosis is less clear. Lymphadenopathy may be the only clinical finding or one of several nonspecific findings and the discovery of swollen lymph nodes will often raise the specter of serious illness such as lymphoma acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or metastatic cancer. The physician's task is to efficiently differentiate the few patients with serious illness from the many with self-limited disease. This article reviews the evaluation of patients with a central clinical finding of lymphadenopathy emphasizing the identification of patients with serious illness.Definition The body has approximately 600 lymph nodes but only those in the submandibular axillary or inguinal regions may normally be palpable in healthy people.1 Lymphadenopathy refers to nodes that are abnormal in either size consistency or number. There are various classifications of lymphadenopathy but a simple and clinically useful system is to classify lymphadenopathy as “generalized” if lymph nodes are enlarged in two or more noncontiguous areas or “localized” if only one area is involved. Distinguishing between localized and generalized lymphadenopathy is important in formulating a differential diagnosis. In primary care patients with unexplained lymphadenopathy approximately three fourths of patients will present with localized lymphadenopathy and one fourth with generalized lymphadenopathy (Figure 1).23 ......and more follows.http://www.aafp.org/afp/1998/1015/p1313.html Why googling your symptoms is not a good idea http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248104.phphttp://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2011/08/...dr-google.html,Aussie age 61 1987 CIN 111.

2018-08-04T12:10-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi I had a CT scan due to a gallbladder attack last week and it showed a 2cm cyst on right ovary as well as an enlarged cervix. Can anyone tell me if theyve had an enlarged cervix and it ISNT cancer? The only thing Im finding is that it is caused by cancer. I have an appointment with my gynecologist on Thursday but am going crazy with worry. Thanks! Tracy,null,haysfmly
2018-08-03T05:37-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Slightly over ten years ago I had a non-stop period for over a year. After that my periods stopped completely. Every time I went to the doctor the nurse would always ask "when was your last period?" I would explain that I hadn't had a period in X amount of time the nurse would notate that and it was not mentioned again during that visit.  Recently I moved to a new city so I got a new doctor. The nurse asked the same question I explained and the info was notated. But when the doctor actually read my information she asked me about my periods. She expressed shock when she learned that my previous doctor had never prescribed medication to force a period.  She sent me for a transvaginal ultrasound which showed "the endometrial stripe is thickened 17 mm." I was then sent for a OB/GYN consult. She said she would need to do a biopsy. So I was scheduled for and had surgery where the doctor performed a D&C as well as a hysteroscopy. I have a post-op appointment on the 13th to learn the results. At my pre-op appointment the ob/gyn said that the cells will either be pre-cancerous or cancerous. Either way I'll have to have a hysterectomy.  So worry has brought me to this forum. I'm wondering if any of you have had a similar experience. Is it possible to have uterine cancer for years and not know it? I'm not looking for a diagnosis or medical advice. I just want to hear your thoughts and opinions.  Thanks in advance!,null,texaswriter
2018-08-03T23:21-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi I have tons of ob gyn stuff over the yrs Ive had an amblation - just had a uterine biopsy in the spring.  My lining is also thick For now Im taking lupron to force menapause to avoid a hysterectomy  I wouldnt worry to much til the results. A hysterectomy may be in order anyway but it could also be fibroids etc.,null,allysheedy

2018-08-01T05:04-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Age: 26 Sex: F **Weight:**117 lbs (used to be anywhere between 160-180 before the weight loss) Height: 5'3 Complaint: Worried about Cancer (specifically Kidney Cancer Liver Neuroendocrine Spinal and/or the common Pancreatic type) Past/Current Medical History: None except diagnosed with severe OCD and anxiety since I was 9 Current Meds: Only Zoloft I take 250 mg and have been taking it daily since I was 9 (not that high of a dose though which was only upped in recent years) Non-smoker/non-drinker/Virgin Symptoms: Weight loss since November however its important to note that the weight loss started as soon as I started cutting out bread due to thinking I might have celiacs (I was eating like 4 loafs of Challah a day and bread was a major part of my diet other than meat considering I don't really eat fruits and veggies) Elevated liver enzymes on my regular bloodwork during my PCP visit on two seperate occasions however when I went to a different doctor recently the bloodwork I did by him showed my enzymes to be normal so he said it was probably just a lab error with my other doctor not sure what to believe though considering that lab error happened twice. Night sweats that come and go Facial flushing/a feeling of warmth in my face that also comes and goes alongside anxiety attacks/feelings of unease that honestly feel like I've been given an adrenaline/cortisol overdose which sometimes comes along with left hand tremors. Blood in urine alongside a slight spilling of protein that started only recently alongside flank/lower back pain that sometimes radiates to the mid and upper back Weird Bowel Movements: Seems like whenever I eat anything fat it just goes straight through me these days my stools have been light yellow soft and they're tending to float/stick to the toilet. Other things of note: I injured my upper back near my neck/shoulder back in November by leaning very hard and for a long time against a very hard substance the sting from that injury still comes and goes. The facial flushing/night sweats attacks seem to happen most often after I eat something containing gluten all they've found on me so far is a kidney stone which I admit did appear soon after a particularly gluten-heavy eating episode that had been going on for weeks. Tests I've had: Full blood workup and urine test (besides the hematuria and slight protein spill my kidney function was completely normal in the urine and bloodwork) including a full liver and Pancreatic panel everything came back negative/normal (for the Hepatitis A/B/C diseases as well as for any thyroid issues) except for those two elevated liver enzyme incidents at my PCP. I've also recently had both an abdominal Ultrasound and (abdominal) CT scan without contrast and for both of those all they could find was a Kidney stone everything else came back completely clean. (My CT scan in particular was referred to as "grossly unremarkable") My question is though that considering the relative inaccuracy of these scans (compared to say a CT scan done *with* contrast) and all my other symptoms how much stock can I put into these results? Do I probably not have cancer after all and this is just a kidney stone? (which itself might be from Celiacs?) The thing is though my urine test did have traces of protein and I can't find anything online about that being one of the symptoms of a kidney stone. I'm worried that perhaps that injury of my back/spine back in November might have caused a tumor to grow can physical spinal/back injuries trigger tumor growth? To make matters worse a good friend of mine whose uncle is a Radiation Oncologist just told me her uncle said it is extremely difficult to detect any masses on a CT scan without contrast is this true? What's the accuracy percentage rate in picking up masses for a non-contrast CT scan vs one with contrast?,null,EurAsianGirl
2018-08-01T06:26-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Sorry to hear of this. Frankly it sounds like your anxiety/OCD is not currently well controlled. I think that if you had one of the aggressive cancers you fear and which was producing such easily observable symptoms if you were even still alive you might very well be on life support in the hospital. You are doing an incredible amount of workup online - do you have medical training? If you continue to doubt doctors and test results it points more definitively toward poorly controlled anxiety - which can produce many (if not all) of the symptoms that you are experiencing.

Many mundane things can also cause elevated liver enzymes. I notice that you haven't listed a biopsy for celiac disease among your tests which suggests your doctor has no reason to test for it.

The current treatment clearly isn't working and only a qualified professional can help you find something which does work. Anxiety has already been a huge part of your life for a very long time. Don't let it rob you of the present and the future. A healthier diet would probably be a good idea too. If you don't eat fruit and vegetables and you've cut out bread what are you eating?

2018-08-01T06:47-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],With your diet as you describe in detail I’m not surprised you are having odd bowel movements that coupled with gross anxiety makes things worse. I doubt you have cancer given the “unremarkable “ results and no red flags indicated whatsoever. I suggest try and keep things simple rather than apparently jumping to negative conclusions on literally everything. Question If you don’t trust your doctors the interpreted scans your normal blood results physicals etc Why post on a cancer support forum where there is absolutely zero evidence of any form of cancer. We can’t suggest a diagnosis and even if we could we wouldn’t as not even a qualified medical doctor would attempt this on line. As po said try and control the anxiety and above all stop speculating and or wishing for some illness no one ever wants or would wish on another.

You have every reason to distrust what your anxiety is telling you so make dealing with that your priority.I actually did have the blood test for Celiacs done however it wasn't in the most optimal circumstances since for the test to be really accurate you have to be eating gluten daily at least for a month I didn't know that and only ate gluten for 3 days beforehand so those negative results are pretty flimsy to me. Plus I've never had a history of kidney stones this is literally my first one and being so young I'm not sure what else could cause it? I'm only skeptical of test results if they haven't been utilized to their best accuracy and from what I've read about non-contrast CT scans that's true. Unless perhaps you or some of the other forum members here who have experience with them could tell me they ARE generally accurate at picking up/detecting masses? I WOULD be trusting my results if this was a CT scan done with contrast but for now everything people have told me and that I've read have said that a CT scan without contrast is like trying to search for something in a dark dark room.

2018-08-02T05:24-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],CT scans without a contrast medium are reliable at identifying a mass the key is the interpretation. With contrast they obtain greater definition but still it is the interpretation that is criticallly important. I would suggest you are again questioning the validity of the scans and tests you have had all it appears are clear and the scan results were noted as being “grossly unremarkable”. note Should this continuous questioning of results continue I add without a hint of anything found let alone anything cancer related I shall close this thread as it serves no useful purpose other than to provoke you into more questions.

2018-08-03T03:28-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Originally Posted by Baz10CT scans without a contrast medium are reliable at identifying a mass the key is the interpretation. With contrast they obtain greater definition but still it is the interpretation that is criticallly important. I would suggest you are again questioning the validity of the scans and tests you have had all it appears are clear and the scan results were noted as being grossly unremarkable. note Should this continuous questioning of results continue I add without a hint of anything found let alone anything cancer related I shall close this thread as it serves no useful purpose other than to provoke you into more questions. Thats not good for your anxiety  BarryIf that's true how come my friend's uncle who's a renowned radiation oncologist said otherwise and that its typically very difficult for a non-contrast CT scan to pick up/detect any masses? I wouldn't be questioning the validity of scans/tests if I knew beforehand they were the most accurate way possible of picking up tumors (such as if this had been a CT scan WITH contrast) Was your cancer first picked up by a non-contrast CT scan? Has anyone's cancer on this forum been first detected via the use of a non-contrast CT scan?,null,Baz10

2017-06-28T08:57-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi guys hope you can help my white blood count is 12000 and has been taken again yesterday so I'm waiting for results.

Any advice would be appreciated,null,Rome1979
2017-06-28T09:05-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Some friend! Elevated white cell counts almost always point to infection. WBC is only a single measure of blood. There are many other factors to measure which can help to narrow down the cause. Why was your blood drawn?,null,po18guy
2017-06-28T09:53-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I thought I had diabetes as I was shattered especially after meals I've been eating better and lost some weight and haven't got diabetes. They repeated my bloods yesterday to check the white blood count. My mother had cervical cancer and died at 30 so that's why I've been really worried,null,Rome1979
2017-06-28T23:57-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],White cell count alone only means that your immune system has been activated to fight some unknown pathogen (infection) or possibly that your bone marrow may be acting up for some reason. Further testing is needed.,null,po18guy
2017-06-28T13:59-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I thought elevated white count was sign of infection. Well I think there are a few things that can cause it. Even stress and smoking can. I don't think 12000 is really that much elevated. Mine is almost always elevated every time time a CBC is done and has been like that for years n years. I do not have luekima and never have. 3 weeks ago I had blood work to check something else and it was 14000.  I wouldn't think leukemia based just on an elevated white count..,null,Careful1
2017-06-28T14:24-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],<--------- What PO18guy said!! Your white cell count doesn't mean diddly squat. Leukemia is a disease where your body starts making flawed genetic copies of the white cells and if that happens THEN you are in deep doo-doo. For example my diagnosis is CD34 with T(3:3) "short arm" mutation. You need a bone marrow biopsy which isn't a big deal to PROVE that you actually have leukemia. The house rules in here are that you don't have cancer unless you have a clinical diagnosis PROVING you do. Leukemia is also quite rare compared to a "popular" form like prostate cancer which everybody and their dog has... So quit listening to poorly informed "friend" who doesn't know the difference between leukemia and a Depends with a full load on board to put it politely. Come to think of it a soiled Depends is probably the ONLY thing that your "friend" IS qualified to diagnose. So relax find out what your immune system is objecting to and leave it at that unless your doctor says otherwise.  P.S.: My AML which turned out to refractory (terminal) was only caught by a pre-op physical for a full knee replacement and my white cell count was just barely LOW enough to make the doctor look keep looking for a cause. If it hadn't been a pre-op physical for MAJOR surgery nobody would have given that score a 2nd thought.,05/6/16 pre-op physical for surgery show low WBC & RBC 5/22/16 [Birthday] Results of BM biopsy: AML 25% blasts with inv t(3:3) mutation HIGH risk 5/30/16 Undergo 3+7 chemo but it doesn't touch AML infections nearly kill me.

2018-07-27T22:18-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I am an only child and I lost my dad to brain cancer when I was 9. I have an intense fear of cancer due to this and now my worst nightmare is coming true. While she hasn't yet been diagnosed I am preparing myself to be told on Tuesday that my mum has colon cancer.  She has been feeling breathless and unwell for months her stomach makes this awful loud gurgling sound ALL the time and she's had back pain yet she only just went to the doctor last week. She was told she has severe anaemia. After a clear gastroscopy she is scheduled for a colonoscopy on Tuesday. She doesn't google things like me so is acting like all is fine. But I know anaemia is a major symptom of colon cancer - and that combined with her stomach noises and the fact she barely eats anything has me absolutely terrified.  She has just turned 70 - I'm 36 I have a 3-year-old and I'm 25 weeks pregnant. I lost my 93 year old grandmother two months ago and I come from a very small family. I'm not strong enough to lose someone else. I'm not strong enough to go through cancer. I'm not strong enough to watch my mother get sick. I'm not strong enough for this. And honestly I don't think she is either. My daughter and I are all she lives for and she watched my dad die I don't think she's strong enough to fight. I am so terrified I can't function. All I do is cry. I look at my daughter who she absolutely adores and think of all the love she will miss out on if my mum dies. I can't eat I can't work - I just want to sleep and forget this is all happening. Two weeks ago we were fine - and now this. I look at all my friends who have two parents and wonder why this is happening to me again. All the joy in my life has been ripped away and I feel like I will never find it again. This is supposed to be a happy time with a new baby on the way but if she has cancer I'm the only person she has to rely on and that is a lot to take on. I can't lose my mum. I won't survive. I won't. I have never felt so distraught lost and hopeless in my life.,null,charloco
2018-07-28T12:04-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I'm sorry you're going through this fear and uncertainty. You don't mention your location which might actually be relevant here. Googling will not help you. You can have all the red flag symptoms of CRC and not have cancer and you can have none of the symptoms and still have cancer. Only specific testing is going to give you any definite answers. Elderly people being anaemic is not uncommon and nor is them having a reduced appetite. Your mother's doctor has moved quickly on this and that's a good thing. Potentially serious causes need to be ruled in or out so that appropriate treatment can be arranged. Your UK spelling suggests that you may live in a Commonwealth country. If so do you know if your mother has been participating in a national bowel cancer screening programme on a regular basis prior to now (these are usually for people between 50 and 74 and here in Australia they are mailed out for people to do at home and return by mail)?,null,Sparkle Lolie
2018-07-28T01:02-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Thanks so much for your reply. I'm in New Zealand. We do have a national screening programme but my mother hasn't done it to my knowledge.  She'll only go to the doctor when she really really has to - I've told her so many times to go to the doctor about her breathlessness (anaemia) and grumbling stomach but she's just shrugged it off.  I know there can be other reasons but deep down I think the worst news of my life is coming. I just truly don't know how to cope.  I have a problem with catastrophising anyway so rather than thinking about the next weeks or months I think of what's to come over the next few years and all the pain and distress my family will have to go to. I don't think I can live without my mum. I can't breathe at the thought. I feel like a truck is sitting on my chest.  I've lost 2 kilos which being pregnant is not good. I hate people who say 'why me' but why me? Surely I've been through enough?,null,charloco
2018-07-28T02:27-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],For the sake of yourself and your children I'd strongly suggest that you get some help for dealing with your anxiety. You being anxious isn't going to change the outcome of your mum's tests but it will have an enormous impact on your day to day life and that of your children. Worrying about the future will rob you of the present and you won't get those moments back. One thing you can do is use this as an opportunity to get an overall assessment of your mum's health conducted. If she hasn't been keeping up with screening programmes that can be remedied now. If she hasn't been keeping up with general health assessments and vaccinations that can be addressed now.  If tests show that your mother does have cancer then the hospital providing treatment will be able to refer you to support resources for yourself. If she doesn't then it sounds like you could still use some support resources anyway. It can be tough dealing with young children and ageing parents at the same time especially if you're doing that alone.,null,Sparkle Lolie
2018-07-28T03:26-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I can’t add any more that has been said except. Googling general symptoms will magnify the concerns you have.

2018-07-28T04:02-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],You don't mention whether you live close to your mum but if you do the bowel prep can be a bit rough and it might help if you can check on her throughout that and make sure she's not having any problems with it and that she's keeping up fluids the day before. Are you going to be collecting you mum from the colonoscopy and staying with her that night or will someone else be doing that? You should be given their initial findings before you mum goes home although if they take any tissue samples you'll still have to wait for pathology to confirm those findings. By the way if you read Barry's signature you'll notice that he does have CRC. He was diagnosed way back in 2011 so even if your mum does have colon cancer it doesn't necessarily she won't be around much longer.,null,Sparkle Lolie

I find it odd that there's been no mention of CRC being a possibility as informed consent is required for the procedure and the literature people are given prior to the procedure tends to mention it as being one of the possible findings. Again I seriously urge you to get help for your anxiety. If your mum is facing something serious then your anxiety will compromise your ability to support her through it. Even if she isn't facing anything serious right now she is elderly and this is unlikely to be the only time concerns about her health will arise in the coming years.  You haven't mentioned how your mum is coping with the bowel prep so far. Can you check on that today and make sure that she has everything on hand that she'll need for her liquids only day tomorrow and also that she's stopped any medications she was told to stop and isn't struggling with the low residue diet she'll have been told to follow for 2-4 days?  Especially make sure that she understands the times that she'll last be able to eat anything and when she needs to cease fluids on the day of her procedure. Make sure that she's set an alarm for waking up and drinking the last of the bowel prep if her procedure is in the morning. I know it's hard but try to focus on the couple of days immediately in front of you at the moment - everything else is just "what if" right now. There are concrete things which need to happen during that time and you can make dealing with them easier for your mum.,null,charloco

2018-07-31T01:28-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],My mother died from breast cancer when she was 28 years of age so i'm a bit worried even though I realize breast cancer in men is rare. Around 2 weeks ago I can remember feeling my right nipple and thinking that behind it was a bit hard but didn't think nothing much of it. However last Sunday night I felt the area again and noticed the area was still hard and behind my left nipple was soft like usual. It was then that I investigated the area and found a bit of a lump. When I moved my right nipple and the area around it around the lump stayed the same. I called up to the Doctors Monday morning and the Doctor investigated me he estimated the lump to be 1.5cm across. I then saw the nurse who wrote a letter for me to be seen as the breast clinic at the hospital in my town. That was 7 days ago ago now they said i'd hopefully be seen within 2 weeks. The lump is still present and isn't going away. The nurse said it could be Mastitis. I read up on breast cancer on wikipedia and it said obesity is a factor in getting breast cancer i'm around 50lbs overweight so there's that. Overall I realise since i'm male that my chances of having breast cancer is low but my Mother died from it so i'm a bit nervous.,null,Krazy101

2018-07-26T18:25-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Sorry to hear of this. The other thread had been inactive for 5+ years so I moved your post to its own thread.  What all of that means is that further diagnostics is warranted - probably having one of those nodes out. It's a simple walk-in walk-out provecure. No scan no image no doctor - but a pathologist can state that you have cancer.

2018-07-28T04:30-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],You'd be much better off getting your doctor to explain but I'll take an uneducated shot at it: the scan sees an unknown type of swollen mass - big enough to feel - that lies over your submandibular gland (i.e. the gland itself isn't swollen). The pair of glands themselves are roughly symmetrical meaning that one isn't swollen more than the other. There's no other evidence of swollen lymph nodes.  Seems to me like a possible abscess or cyst - some type of tissue not normally found in that region. I'm sure your doc can explain much better.,DX - 5/2010 Grade 1 Stage 4 fNHL - w/spleen and 47% bone marrow involvement TX - 6/2010-12/2010: SWOG S0801- R-CHOP + Bexxar + Rituxan (4 yrs/quarterly) Restaged (post Bexxar) - PCR-Neg/NED :2/2011  Rituxan maintenance ended 3/2015 1/2018: Remission continues (>7 years) Down to one checkup/year!,Defens

2018-07-28T21:25-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hey everybody. I have strange symptoms going on. Every I drink bear I feel pain in my body. I feel pain in my jaw going to the bottom of my ear. I also had a lymph node under my right ear pop up but disappear to where it cant be felt nomore. I have pains in my arms when drinking beer but when I had a mri of my left arm it showed tendonitis. I had a Sonogram if my right underarm and it showed everything was fine. Months ago when the symptoms werent very noticeable. I had a CT scan of my chest and everything was fine. I also did a CT scan of my abdomen and pelvis(I also feel some pain in my groin area) with contrast and everything was fine too. I had a fatty lump come but disappear on my thigh along with a nasty looking lump in between in my inner thigh that a doctor told me was a abscess. I did a ct scan of my neck with contrast and they found nothing. Im just lost. I sat and drunk a bear earlier and the pain came yet again all over my body. Im not looking for cancer but trying to figure out whats wrong with my body Which always seems to involve a lump pain or lymph node which leads my mind to scary places. Just a few weeks ago I had a black little lump appear on my knee with a black background that is still here. Im a man in my late 20s.,null,Zekeweakly
2018-07-29T01:43-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],hey everyone. I have a lot of scary symptoms happening right now so I’m going to give you all a quick breakdown. The most serious symptom is I feel pain all over my body when I drink beer. Before I drink it I feel pain in certain areas or no pain at all in those moments. Soon as I drink I feel pain all over. I also feel pain in my chin and ear(even without drinking alcohol. I know that pin with alcohol is usually associated with Lymphoma and that has had me worried for months. To give you a quick run down of everything 1. Ct scan neck with contrast= everything was fine 2. CT scan of chest(and X-rays too) everything is fine MRI of left shoulder= tendonitis  Sonogram of right underarm=everything is fine CT scan of abdomen and pelvis= everything is fine MRI of foot= tendonitis bone marrow edema. CBC= everything is fine MRI of spine=everything is fine for the most part To give you another run down on what I’m feeling I have a fatty lump that appears on my thigh then disappears I have pin in the jaw that stretches to under my ear I had a lymph node pop up under my right ear that eventually went down I have this black lump worth a black background on my knee that came out of nowhere Again pain with alcohol every time. Groin pain that comes and goes Had a lump that appeared near my groin but disappeared I have all these different symptoms that always involve lump pain or lymphnodes but the test I’ve taken so far have shown nothing. I’m just lost. I’m not looking for cancer but what’s going on,null,Zekeweakly
2018-07-29T02:37-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],With a variety of scans showing no unusual activity with your lymph nodes it isn't likely that you have lymphoma. Reaction to alcohol is a potential symptom but for it to be as severe as you're experiencing you should be seeing something in the scans. Since lymphoma is pretty rare a more likely possibility is that you have an allergic reaction to bears - or even possibly to beer. Do you have the same reaction if you drink wine or distilled beverages? If not maybe you're having an allergic reaction not to the alcohol but to some component of the beer - grain or hops.  Get tested for allergies would be my advice.,DX - 5/2010 Grade 1 Stage 4 fNHL - w/spleen and 47% bone marrow involvement TX - 6/2010-12/2010: SWOG S0801- R-CHOP + Bexxar + Rituxan (4 yrs/quarterly) Restaged (post Bexxar) - PCR-Neg/NED :2/2011  Rituxan maintenance ended 3/2015 1/2018: Remission continues (>7 years) Down to one checkup/year!,Defens

As Defens has said you issue with alcohol could be for many reasons and you need to work with your doctor to try to find out the problem and a first step may be to stop drinking alcohol and see what happens. You say yourself you are not looking for cancer and the scans are clear of signs of cancer so the is little more we can advise therefore I am closing this thread and wish you luck on finding answers.

Over the past few months I have had gas that leaves me uncomfortable at times. I thought nothing of it - Mom had a lot of gas. So 4 days ago I started to become constipated which was strange cus I rarely have problems with my bowls (except gas). 3 days past with few farts and the few tikes when I was able to go it wasa thin small thing that was hard to get out. Finally got fed up and took a laxative (milk of Magnesia) which had me going 4-ish hours later. The first burst was semi hard and there was bright red blood in the bowl. The second time I went the blood was a bit less but more stringy and mucusy and in clots. Since its been watery diarrhea but I'm keeping an eye on it. Haven't seen anyone yet but I will be booking something with my doctor. Normally I wouldn't worry much but Mom died of colon cancer at 48 5yrs prior so I'm a bit paranoid.  Thanks for any advice.,null,Teefsh

I am sorry your worries have brught you here but all I can tell you is that you are already doing the right thing by getting yourself in to see your doctor.

Remission confirmed July 09 Restaged to Stage 3 May 2010 Recurrence confirmed May 2010 - Watch and Wait commenced - multiple scans with minimal progression. Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma diagnosed September 2012. Mohs surgical excision 09/2012. Successful clean edges all around. Significant progression detected in PET scan - December 2012 Biopsy to check for transformation 1/18/2013 - negative for that but full of lymphoma of course. July 2013 - Rescan due to progression shows one tumor (among many) very suspect for transformation another biopsy 8/12/13.  August 2013 - No evidence of transformation 6 courses of B+R commence 8/29 due to "extensive systemic disease". February 2014 - Diagnostic PET scan states: Negative PET scan. Previous noted hypermetabolic cervical axillary iliac and inguinal lymphadenopathy has resolved. Doctor confirms full remission. June 2014 - started 2 year maintenance Rituxan 1 infusion every 3 months. Doctor confirms lump under right arm are "suspicious" for recurrent disease deferring scans for now. February 2015 - Doc and I agreed to stop R maintenance as it is depressing my immune system too much.  June 2015 - Confirm that the beast is back by physical exam will scan in August after esophageal issues settle down so we can get a clear view. August 2015 - physical exam in error PET/CT shows no evidence of disease. Remission continues well into second year! December 2015 - Cardiologist tells me I have plaque buildup growing at an alarming rate. Stent or bypass down the road but not yet... March 2016 - new tumor below the jaw so remission is over. Back to active surveillance until treatment is needed. June 2016 - C/T scan indicates presence of multiple lesions in iliac chain. August 2016 - PET/CT shows multiple areas of lymphoma as expected plus new areas of concern in bowel. January 2017 - C/T scan shows significant progression in cervical and inguinal lymph chains largest tumor is impacting hearing measures 2.1x4.6 cm. 4 to 8 cycles of R-CVP 1x3weeks to commence 2/6/17. April 2017 - Mid treatment scan shows about 1/3 reduction in multiple tumors. Also shows abdominal aortic aneurysm with peripheral thrombus. Cardiologist changed meds spoke of need for surgical repair down the road. September 2017 - finished 10 rounds of R-CP V was stopped due to neuropathy in feet. No further treatment planned at this time at least 10 tumors can be felt which seem to be growing again. December 2017 - Biopsy of external iliac node with SUV of 13.1 shows no transformation! However the FL grade is now 3A instead of Gr 1-2. Will start indefinite protocol using Copanlisib one of the new targeted therapies. I remain hopeful. March 2018 - Copanlisib failed treatment stopped 3/28. New plan is to go to Dana Farber on 4/16 for case review and treatment recommendation. May 2018 - did not qualify for clinical trials at Dana Farber. Tumors need to get larger to be considered. On consultation w/Dr. Armand at DF and my onc have decided to take a break from cancer treatments. Will have a biopsy of the mass in my sinus discovered in scan at DF and to get the aneurysm repaired as it has developed a potentially catastrophic penetrating ulcer.

2015-08-06T02:43-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I'm 32 year old male waiting on a colonoscopy on aug.12. I have high anxiety over the possibility of colon cancer. I've had 4mnths LLQ abdominal pain above my hip usually however it goes away and sometimes ends up in my lower left back or groin. Stool test found microscopic blood and some stool shows spots of black tar. Blood tests show good findings for liver function and hemoglobin. Have occasional difficult bowel movements but have bowel movement twice a day. Bowel movements tend to be 1/2"-3/4" thick and vary in length from long and snaky to two or three inches. The pain is either slight burning or slight pressure. I realize that the level of anxiety I have could add to symptoms aggravate an IBS but I just want to know if this sounds like anyone's symptoms and what stage they were diagnosed at. I feel I have to apologize because all I have now is fear were as you are all currently fighting your own difficult battles and I do appreciate any guidance you can give.,null,Cortillion
2015-08-06T03:47-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Cortillion No need for apologies as we have all been in your situation and understand your anxiety. None of us can say whether you have CRC or not as there are a number of digestive and bowel disorders that exhibit the same symptoms your having including as you mention IBS. You have had a occult stool test which showed positive for blood trace so your doctor is erring on the safe side to either rule CRC in or out only the upcoming colonoscopy can do this. You are definately getting ahead of the game by asking what stage so obviously you have been doing Internet research ?. If you have then I suggest you stop as any site you go on will lead you to "You have CRC" mostly I add with your symptoms it turns out to be something other than colon cancer. Waiting for a procedure is always a worrying time we have all been there so know exactly your worries.

2015-08-06T04:34-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Thanks Baz I've been waiting two months for this colonoscopy since I found out there was blood in the stool test. I've had the pain for four months but it wasn't until I found out about the bleeding that my anxiety went out of control. I feel ashamed because I always had a indifferent view of cancer. I believed I was too young to worry about it but since I've started reading these forums and the people who struggle and hold on to eachother I've come to realize how shallow and naive I was. I hope with all my heart I don't have cancer but whether I do or not I know I'm going to change and work towards helping beat cancer in whatever way I can.,null,Cortillion

2015-08-07T04:18-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I'm afraid it's just the way I am when it comes to medical issues. I tend to shut down. So close to the colonoscopy and it feels like an execution day. I of course realize regardless of the findings it isn't a real execution. I've read lots of forums on this site of overcoming bad odds and surviving with cancer I just truely do not do well with such uncertainty. I lost about 7lbs in three weeks and my appetite when I found out about the blood in my stool test. I feel drained sometimes but I think it might have a lot to do with my attitude because I can still do tasks like mow the lawn with ease. It's like you have a steady system going in you life and then there is a chance that something could blow it all up. "Men plan God laughs" I of course am afraid of the possibility but I either have it right now or don't if I knew at least I could get myself ready for a fight.,null,Cortillion

2018-07-28T04:30-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],You'd be much better off getting your doctor to explain but I'll take an uneducated shot at it: the scan sees an unknown type of swollen mass - big enough to feel - that lies over your submandibular gland (i.e. the gland itself isn't swollen). The pair of glands themselves are roughly symmetrical meaning that one isn't swollen more than the other. There's no other evidence of swollen lymph nodes.  Seems to me like a possible abscess or cyst - some type of tissue not normally found in that region. I'm sure your doc can explain much better.,DX - 5/2010 Grade 1 Stage 4 fNHL - w/spleen and 47% bone marrow involvement TX - 6/2010-12/2010: SWOG S0801- R-CHOP + Bexxar + Rituxan (4 yrs/quarterly) Restaged (post Bexxar) - PCR-Neg/NED :2/2011  Rituxan maintenance ended 3/2015 1/2018: Remission continues (>7 years) Down to one checkup/year!,Defens

2018-07-24T21:09-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi all. Mid 30s male. I got extremely sick early may. 105 fever nonstop puking and diarrhea for a week straight. Drs said no flu but couldnt figure it out.  Ever since then my stomach has been a train wreck. Ive always had issues with pooping. Multiple times a day usually loose and wet.  Stuff got really worse a few weeks ago. Bouts of cramping/stabbing feeling in my left side of belly button. More frequent diarrhea some weight loss lack of appetite and insane night sweats. But I also started pooping blood. Sometimes a bowl full sometimes just big globs in my poop and almost always when I wipe. I also found out im anemic. Im always exhausted lately and extremely stiff.  Mostly ive been going around 10x a day now. Almost always loose and wet. It has mucus in it like i launched a snot rocket. When i do poop solid its very very thin like a pencil.  Went to gi dr and they ran celiacs and stool tests for infections and parasites. All came back negative. Found blood in my stool on another test also.  They ordered a ct scan and most of it was unremarkable. Minus an enlarged spleen (17.2cm) and something  well ill just type it out from the report.  There is mild diverticulosis without acute diverticulitis. No bowel obstructions free intraperitoneal air  or abcess is seen. There is a paucity of oral contrast within the colon particularly leftward limiting evaluation for bowel wall thickening. The veriform appendix appears normal.  Now I have no clue what any of that is especially the oral contrast part in the colon. So of course im slightly concerned about the chance of colon cancer since it runs in the family. Could someone explain that oral contrast issue (what would cause it) and wtf diverticulosis is?! The pa didnt really tell me much on the phone besides the fact the dr is on vacation until mid August and they will set up a colonoscopy for when he returns. But wouldnt a ct scan show cancer? Thanks all!,null,Rb789

The pa didn’t really tell me much on the phone besides the fact the dr is on vacation until mid August and they will set up a colonoscopy for when he returns. But wouldn’t a ct scan show cancer? Thanks all!There wasn't enough contrast for them to get good images. It could be because you didn't drink enough contrast but it's more likely a timing issue with the scan being done either too soon or too long after you drank the contrast. Diverticulosis is little pockets in your colon wall. On its own it's usually not a problem but if those little pockets become inflamed or infected you can develop diverticulitis which can be serious. In the past people with diverticulosis used to be advised to avoid certain foods but thinking on that has changed recently. Some gastro viruses can cause damage which takes months for your body to repair but given your family history and some of your symptoms a colonoscopy is warranted. No imaging is as good as being able to examine your colon directly and take samples of anything suspicious. If nothing of any significance is found you'll have your baseline colonoscopy - and that's important in someone with a family history. You don't mention the age at which family members have been diagnosed. If you don't have that information then try to obtain it - it's something your specialist will want to know. Did you just have a normal CT scan or did you have CT colonography and have to do bowel prep? A CT scan can detect some types of suspicious lesions in the colon but there are others that it's not particularly good at picking up. Your CT scan can't show cancer. It can only indicate the presence of something which needs further investigation. One word of caution. A lot of the language around bowel cancer screening is scary so make sure that you clarify what it means and don't make assumptions. For example my colonoscopy results put me in the "high risk" group which needs to be monitored more closely but the majority of "high risk" lesions do not become cancer.,null,Rb789
2018-07-24T22:42-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Thanks for your response! It was just an abdominal and pelvic ct scan with contrast. Had to drink a big bottle the night before and a big bottle 2 hours before scan. Then they injected something via iv into my arm. Im glad to hear that its a lack of contrast. I was afraid it was a polyp or something blocking it.  They were in their early 40s when diagnosed.  Ahh thanks for the diverticulosis information. My wife had mentioned ill have to avoid certain foods.  They claimed my sickness was probably norovirus but hey who knows.  Thanks again so much!,null,Rb789

My wife had mentioned ill have to avoid certain foods.  They claimed my sickness was probably norovirus but hey who knows.  Thanks again so much!OK. If you have first degree relatives who were diagnosed in their early 40s then your first colonoscopy should have been in your early 30s. Even if you had no symptoms at all you need a colonoscopy. Your sickness was almost certainly a virus although it could have been diverticulitis. Now you know that you have diverticulosis it's something to be aware of in the future and to mention if you ever find yourself having to present at the ED with severe abdominal/gastric symptoms. Minor episodes can be managed with a low residue diet until the symptoms resolve (it's the same diet they often get you to eat for a few days prior to a colonoscopy) but severe episodes need medical management. Colonoscopies are going to be part of your future but how often you'll need them depends on the results of this first one. There are massive amounts of research happening in respect of CRC at the moment and the ability to accurately predict individual risk is only going to improve in your lifetime. Even if you find the current surveillance protocols tiresome (and they are) be aware that they will change as current knowledge is refined. I don't know if it's any consolation to you but your illness in May might be a blessing in disguise. It's led to you having a colonoscopy which should have already been done based on your family history alone. Who knows how much longer you might have gone without having one done had you not got sick.,null,Rb789

2018-07-24T17:54-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi I'm 3 years post-menopause and had some spotting a couple weeks ago it was light and only lasted 1 day. Saw my OB/GYN yesterday and told her about it. She said I could do the biopsy but should wait to see if I get spotting again. I'd like to err on the side of caution but not sure if I should worry or proceed with it.  Basically I wanted to see if anyone here had similar spotting and can offer any advice if I should do the biopsy or wait. She said it's VERY painful but of course I'm willing to endure it to find out for sure.  Any thoughts on this are appreciated! Thanks!,null,moopy

2018-07-14T20:15-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hello all  A little background: I am a 22 year old female I noticed in April of this year that one side of my neck was enlarged compared to the other I blew it off thinking it was an infection and decided to see if it would go down on its own. In June with no changes I saw my PCP to check it out she ordered an ultrasound and CBC with 10 days of strong antibiotics. Blood work was normal but The ultrasound revealed several bilateral enlarged cervicle lymph nodes the largest at 3cm. After the antibiotics were completed I went back for a second ultrasound lymph nodes still present. 2 weeks later another ultrasound lymph nodes still present. I was then referred to a hematologist/oncologist who also felt some lymph nodes in my armpit along with the ones in my neck. The doctor ordered a CT of my neck abdomen and groin with contrast. She mentioned the possibility of hodgkins. Has anyone also gone through this? What should I expect with the CT? How long do results take? Any advice or information is gladly welcomed. Thank you.,null,Hb1234
2018-07-15T07:39-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi I had NHL so have been through all of this the CT scan prep can take an hour drinking a lovely concoction they will put a cannula in your hand or wrist to inject a contrast liquid and the scan takes minutes they will do two passes of the area the haematologist has requested and you will be told to hold your breath when they do each scan.  As for results these can take hours or a couple of days as they have to be checked and written up by a consultant radiologist. You should get your follow up appointment if you don't have one and thats when you should get your results. As for whether it lymphoma and what type - well only time will tell. If the scan shows lymphoma then they will need a biopsy so they can type it the are 6 types of HL and at least 80 types of NHL and lots of other auto immune diseases if something is wrong.

2018-07-22T01:25-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I am currently going through the same thing. I am 29 F. I just saw hematology/oncology Thursday and have my CT scan on Monday. Mine started in axillary lymph nodes and now I have one enlarged one in my neck also. My blood work has also been normal. The best thing we can do is to get the testing done advocate for ourselves and ask questions of our doctor's. The next step for me is a biopsy after the CT scan results. Only that will tell. Good luck with everything and if you need someone to talk to I am all ears.,null,bmaco88
2018-07-25T12:08-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Thank you John! You were right about how everything would go. I got the neck and chest CT done but insurance is fighting right now about the abdomen/ pelvis. The chest and neck showed what we already knew enlarged lymph nodes on both sides of the neck and under the chin and an enlarged node under my right armpit. As of right now I can feel what I think is a node in my groin area but who knows until the scan is done. I'm getting frustrated because I just want answers and to know what's wrong.

2018-07-14T12:48-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I always made sure to bring my notebook with me to write down what they said. I took my IPad with me and put it on video but I didn’t video the appts. I sat it beside me so I would just catch the conversation. When I went home I’d listen to it and write down notes. From those I would form my questions I had and asked them at the next appt. I-would call if I had an urgent question. I would probably ask if he was going to biopsy them. I personally don’t like fine needle aspirations. We were told my husband’s were benign after one of those. His dr. retired and a younger dr. took over and insisted on a sonogram and biopsies which then showed it was cancer.

Here non urgent results are available within 24 hours - although your doctor can request them being faxed through earlier. We pick up our own images here though unless they're done in a hospital so everyone just opens them and reads the report the moment they're out the door.

2018-07-21T17:49-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi all. I came up here a while back because of my concerns of having lymphoma. My excisional biopsy of my supraclavicular node was benign. It was read by two separate pathologists (yay.. kind of?) well oncologist said we would just follow up with another CT in 3 months to make sure things are going down. Well had my CT and they are NOT. Ive had painless swollen lymph nodes since March and other strange symptoms. ALL my supraclavicular nodes are palpable. I have nodes on both sides of neck and one you can see behind my ear. 4 inguinal nodes are swollen along with retroperitoneal and mesentric. Every node has grown since last time about 4 mm. The retroperitoneal is pushing 2 cm. I DONT UNDERSTAND. I meet with my doctor Monday. I have about 14 nodes over 1 cm in random places. I guess its a good sign my first biopsy was benign but at this point I wonder if it was the wrong node. Ive been negative for most auto immune diseases they have tested me for. Im at a loss Im also losing my hair and I have severe itching when I get out of the shower mostly on my feet.,null,cab9792

2018-07-24T10:47-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Well Ive been seeing an oncologist about this and she said since my first biopsy was benign she said a second one probably wouldnt show anything and that she wasnt concerned. She asked if I wanted to do another biopsy and I said yes definitely. My retroperitoneal node went from 1.2 to 1.6 in 3 months but she didnt recommend going for that node Since it would be very hard to do. She also did not schedule anymore follow up ct scans and just scheduled me for a 6 month office visit in January. This really concerns me that my lymph nodes are growing and she isnt scheduling me for another scan to follow up with this. But I guess shes the cancer doctor...,null,cab9792

2018-07-13T21:22-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I posted a few weeks ago about lymph nodes and various other symptoms I have been having since October. My PCP has finally referred me to hematology/oncologist due to a 2.8cm lymph node in my neck and a 3.7cm lymph node under my arm. Are there any questions that I should ask at that appointment? I really am trying to be as prepared and well informed as I can. What can I expect at my first visit with a hematologist? Thank you for any replies.,null,bmaco88
2018-07-14T12:48-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I always made sure to bring my notebook with me to write down what they said. I took my IPad with me and put it on video but I didn’t video the appts. I sat it beside me so I would just catch the conversation. When I went home I’d listen to it and write down notes. From those I would form my questions I had and asked them at the next appt. I-would call if I had an urgent question. I would probably ask if he was going to biopsy them. I personally don’t like fine needle aspirations. We were told my husband’s were benign after one of those. His dr. retired and a younger dr. took over and insisted on a sonogram and biopsies which then showed it was cancer. Keeping my own records helped a lot. Good luck to you.,His fight is over. How brave he was. 47 years of love.,Marian333

2018-07-22T19:00-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hello I understand that there will be more serious queries on these forums but I am in turmoil over something in my throat. I have just turned 30 and here are my symptoms: Its only on the left hand side of my neck. Lying on the bed and swallowing I get a very sharp pain which has been the case for the last several months now (so I tend not to lie that side). Recently (4 weeks ago) I developed a sore throat as well as pain outside of the neck. Went to the doctors and they prescribed me some antibiotics. These did not work so after returning they did a throat swab which came back negative for bacterial infection. They have told me to see a throat/neck specialist however I am working away from home and they said there is no point being put on the waiting list so that I should wait until I get back home. The pain has gotten worse. I get ear ache and pain in my jaw. All left side only. I feel like there is something in my throat and becomes more apparent when swallowing. It's sore and aches with random sharp stabbing pains. No signs of external lumps however one of my lymph glands on the left hand side swells up and down randomly. I am really tired exhausted and not sleeping well at all. I am really anxious about it however my weight has not changed and I am still eating well. Do you think waiting a few more weeks will be ok? It feels like its getting worse. I doubt it's anything beside a viral infection however I just don't like the idea of not finding cancer early and then its too late. Any help is appreciated. Thank you for your time. Rob.,null,Zeh

2018-07-22T16:20-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hello. Please excuse me if I have broken etiquette I am just really worried and after some advice. I am 33 (very nearly 34) male and generally in good health. I have had a niggling sore throat on one side (right) now for what seems like months. I was sent by doctors to see a specialist who put a camera up/down my nose and he said he couldnt see anything scary but sent me for an MRI scan. Halfway through the MRI I was taken out of the tube and spoke to the head radiologist. She gave my neck the once over with an ultrasound and said there are no glands up but because your throat is sore we will finish the scan. I think there was some miscommunication as to what it is they were looking for. I got back in the tube and was injected with something to help the imaging show up. Due to mix up she came to see me straight after the scan and said I do not have cancer and that my tonsils were fine although one is bigger than the other. I stopped stressing out at this point.  Two weeks later I saw another ENT specialist guy who said that he thinks Im ok but the MRI is not the gold standard test and he wants to put me under a general put a special tube down my throat and remove my tonsils. He said it was my decision but he advised I have it done to put a line under everything. I am now back to square one waiting and worrying. I mean what else could it be? The pain is more like an ache than a soreness. Diflam spray helps and I can swallow ok although there does seem to be a lump in my throat. Surgery will be W/C 10th August that seems a long way away. I have also found a small round lump in where my pubic hair is on the right hand side. Not seen the doctor because I presume its a cyst but having a look online it could be a lymph gland? Dont know what to do for the best right now and any ideas would be appreciated (and probably help me sleep tonight). Thomas,null,thomasmurry1984

2018-07-22T16:51-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Thank you po18guy for your response. Looking at the list of treatments you have had I commend you; hope youre doing ok now! I did think that but Ive had tonsillitis before and it was much more sore than this but never lasted so long. I was given some antibiotics (Amoxicillin I think) by my GP initially but that did little to reduce the discomfort. My research tells me that cancer does not grow on the surface and MRI isnt optimum for discovery of cancer so can be missed by the throat scope and the MRI. I just wish my specialist had told me what it could be as its getting to me now. Again thank you for responding and hope I do not come across insensitive. Thomas,null,thomasmurry1984
2018-07-22T17:07-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Tonsillitis is either an acute or a chronic condition. A very helpful thing to recall is that our bodies are not either healthy or cancerous.

I do actually have a one sided sore throat and sore ear though and it is definitely not in my head. Ill just keep taking paracetamol and ibuprofen until my tonsils come out. Do you think the scan would have shown something? And if it were something sinister how fast do these cells grow? I think a lot of the concern and mistrust comes from my Aunty. They kept telling her she was fine until she was diagnosed with liver cancer (bloods and scans appeared normal I believe) - she was dead a year later.

2018-07-22T17:32-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hello everyone I have a good friend facing the possiblity of lung cancer but she has some confusion..  She is 54 years old and went to the emergency room last month for a cough that wouldnt go away. They performed a chest x ray and told her she had pneumonia and sent her home with antibiotics.. First week of July she noticed she had a lump on her throat area and made an appointment at the clinic for the following week but come the weekend she started to cough up blood. She went back to the ER where they performed a ct scan of her neck and chest. The one of her neck says she has a nodule on her thyroid and a couple of lymph nodes in her claivical area that measure 2.5cm. The one of her chest says "A large mediastinal subcarinal mass extending into the right helium 9cm with right hilarity adenopathy and metastatic nodules throughout the right lung. Likely small cell carcinoma paratracheal and mediastinal adenopathy consistent with metastatic disease." Of course we dont really know what all that means just the key words really still she is trying to remain postive. She is confused how less then a month before a chest x ray didnt pick up a mass that size unless it was much smaller and grew that big in a couple weeks? Is that even possible? Anyone know? I know you all are not drs and she is trying her very best to be seen however she has no medical insurance which makes everything more difficult. It's been over 2 weeks since she had the ct scan and she was just given referrals from the clinic to see 4 different drs that all require 100s of dollars to be seen if one has no insurance. She did apply for Medicaid but her case is pending still. Please if you all have any advice you can give my friend it really would mean a lot as at this point she is very confused and doesn't know what to do. She hasn't been sleeping well because she cant breath if she lays down. She cant eat because her food gets stuck halfway down and then she coughs to the point of throwing up.  Neither one of us really know how cancer works or what steps need to be taken and she hasn't been able to be told the steps by any dr cause she hasn't been able to see a specialist yet. She really doesn't understand how she could go from no mass seen on a chest x ray to a 9cm mass a couple weeks later. We always hear that it takes a long time for cancer to grow.

2018-07-23T06:50-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],A small mass might not have shown up but more likely the pneumonia changes obscured it. That is why it is fairly common to do a check x- ray after treating pneumonia.,null,Lyssa
2018-07-19T22:34-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I am 36 year old male and I started having the symptoms of Nausea and tightness of the throat about a month ago. I have chronic Hep B but I am in an inactive state. I first went to my liver doctor and she ordered liver function test which showed that my Alt were slightly elevated and my viral load was 2300 iu/ml which puts me borderline of needing medication. She said it is not severe enough to warrant medication since once I start I will likely be on it for the rest of my life. I also did an Ultrasound scan of my abdomen back in June and everything looked fine (the tail of my pancreas could not be seen due to bowel gas).  I went to the ER because the nausea and the feeling of dizziness and throat tightness lasted longer than a week. I also lost my dog the week prior to me feeling these symptoms. The ER doc did a blood test + a CT of my head and I guess couldn't find anything but I left the ER with a diagnosis of Vertigo. My symptoms are still there although much milder and my appetite has improved. Couple days ago I went to see a GI doctor. He ordered an upper endoscopy. His initial impressions were Antral Gastritis and "??EXTRINSIC COMPRESSSION MID BODY STOMACH". I am guessing it's in question mark because the doc isn't sure if that's what it is. I was told my stomach lining looked normal. That compression really have me worried as everything I googled pointed me to something negative. Looking at the picture from that procedure it looks like a bump in the mid upper left side of the body of my stomach. I know that the tail end of the pancreas and the spleen is close to that area. Pathology report will come out in two weeks but my anxiety is extremely high right now. Although symptoms have gotten better they are still there. I am maintaining my weight because I can still eat. I've also never vomited. Urine looks normal. I do experience a slight bloat but that could be just fat. Don't have much pain on my body. Bowel movement seems normal at once a day although I think i have less stool than before but that could be due to me eating less because I stopped going to the gym.  Has anyone have similar experience with this so called extrinsic compression of the stomach? Oh the GI specialist also recommended a CAT scan of abdomen.,null,seannied
2018-07-20T23:44-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],seannied: Sorry to hear you are so worried. I personally have never heard of Extrinsic Compression Mid Body Stomach. The only thing we can suggest is to actually speak with your physician and ask for an explanation. However as of now your physician is not suspicious of cancer yet here you are posting on a cancer forum most likely due to Googling Symptoms. You must keep in mind Google is not a doctor and tends to convince just about anyone they are seriously ill and will point you to the worst case scenario. Now I have had vertigo and dizziness and nausea and common with such a diagnosis. It tends to take a little time to go away and sounds like in your case things are getting better. Follow up with your physician and see what the CAT scan shows once it is done and the report is in. Whatever those results may be ask your doctor to clarify the findings. Good luck to you.

2018-07-20T13:25-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi  This is quite difficult to wait for results without worrying about the worse. You probably are thinking "cancer" and even "pancreatic cancer". However there can be so many other reasons for the symptoms you have and I find that your doctors are doing diligently the right process of elimination. If there is a lesion on the pancreas the CT-scan is the best imaging procedure to find it. Now you should know that pancreatic cancer is extremely rare in people under 50 and the average age at time of diagnosis is 70. Remember also that a lesion is not necessarily malignant; it can be benign cyst.  Unless you have a family history of pancreatic cancer I would not worry. Try not to project yourself in the future and keep your mind busy with positive projects as anyway nothing will happen until you get the results. And doctors always go one step at a time.

2018-07-19T11:36-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hello first I want to make sure I do not come off disrespectful to anyone who has been diagnosed.  I am truly at a loss. Im 28 years old overwheight but have been working on losing weight prior to this. I am concerned I have pancreatic cancer. I was feeling a slightly dull pain upper left abdomen Along with lower back pain. I told my pcp and he said stomach ulcer or pancreatitis. Was sent to er they didnt do any imaging but took blood work and all levels were perfect. I begged for a ct and they refused. I wasnt ok with just blood work. I seen my GI who refused to give me a ct but would give me some other test in 4 weeks if I was still in pain. I forget the name of It. Long story short my pcp wrote me a script but Im paying out of pocket for a ct Im getting a ct this morning. I am sick to my stomach throwing up that I will be told I have Pancreatic cancer. And god willing I dont have It..i have so many anxieties. I read that P.C. doesnt always show up on a ct. this made me even more sick and worried. Can someone please help me. Idk if I should just trust my drs and the CT or do I listen to my concerns and obsessive anxieties about the ct missing something or th drs being wrong. I am desperate I have been out of work the last 3 days because I am beside myself with worry. Help please.,null,Klezoche
2018-07-19T12:01-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi sorry to see you have found your way here but you know the answer to your question deal with your anxiety and trust the doctors the is no benefit to worrying as you are finding out and the flip side is when you do manage the anxiety and worry you will be a much happier person able to enjoy life. I cannot answer your question about the scan but I can tell you many people post about their worries they have PC and none do its not a common cancer in the US especially at your age so seek help with you real issue - anxiety and take back control of your life.,NHL DLBC aggressive stage 4B advanced diagnosed april 09 after 8 rchop and a couple of delays in remission some long term side effects to manage post treatment some blips and investigations on the journey but now 22nd oct 2014 discharged no more hospital visits  we are all on a roller coaster ride riding blind never knowing where the highs and lows are.,johnr
2018-07-19T13:11-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I have moved your thread here to our Worried forum as this is the appropriate place to post without a diagnosis. Johnr is correct it would be highly unusual for someone your age to be diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer as the median age for developing that kind is approximately 70 years old.  You definitely have anxiety issues which you have admitted to. What have you done to address it? At some point you must put faith in the doctors after all they have gone through years of education and training. Doctors do not refer a patient for scans unless absolutely necessary and feel it is warranted. In your case the doctor is not suspicious of cancer and therefore no CT scan was recommended. Now and not to sound harsh there is someone who is at a much higher risk highly suspicious of cancer and yet they have to wait because you demanded a scan and took away the resources for someone who is in an urgent situation. We understand you feel unwell but you must be logical about the course of action you take and listen to your doctors. Please do get your anxiety in order. Should you ever be diagnosed with cancer we will be here without hesitation to support you but for now your doctor is not concerned so you should not be either. If you are not confident with your doctor find another. Lisa,http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/28375-my-mom,lisa1962
2018-07-19T13:57-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],LisaYou are not harsh I respect what you said to me and all honesty that is said to me so I appreciate It more than anything. I am an googler and I’m not proud of It. The only thing that plays in my head is that if the cases of people my age or younger who have actually had pancreatic cancer or the cancer that was missed in the ct. I take all of these peoples stories and make them mine. The guilt I feel for feeling the way I do is huge. I know I have no diagnose and there are many many people who have a diagnose and my heart aches for that. Yet I am so trapped in my own head and thoughts that I’ve become out of control.  My office I usually go to for my therapist and psychologist (I’ve been irresponsible and haven’t gone) Has yet to call me back since Monday and I called Tuesday and nothing so I took It upon myself to make an appt with a therapist at a different office but since it’s a new office I have to start all over which is ok but I’m at a desperate need for help so the waiting is tough.

2018-07-19T15:37-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Very sorry to hear of this. Cancer? Rather what you have is fear. The bodily stress which is produced by fear can manifest itself in innumerable symptoms. Some doctors these days are reluctant to suggest or deal with anxiety - but it is fairly clear from your post that you do struggle with this. Here's the point: you can undergo every test known to mankind receive a clean bill of health but still fear cancer. Anxiety is an insidious condition that steals your peace but is 100% treatable via various means. Address that first as the next fear is waiting around the corner.

2018-07-19T16:34-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I suffered from severe anxiety when we found out my husband had Lymphoma. It literally crippled me. I received a lot of understanding here and POGuy is right......it steals your peace. I listen to a lot of mediation tapes by Jason Stephenson on YouTube. They relax me and often lol me to sleep. But there are many types of meditation tapes on YouTube by other people or just beautiful calming music. I talk to God and Jesus and my husband who is with them. I read my Bible and devotionals. The calmer you are the better it is. Staying busy helps too. As we say here you don’t have cancer until the pathologist says you do. Try to relax...Calm yourself as best you can. I still have some anxiety but it is not as bad as it was. And please stay off Dr. Google. It only irritates anxiety.,His fight is over. How brave he was. 47 years of love.,Marian333

2018-07-20T12:34-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I know I have anxiety. I do. And It bothers me a lot! I just can’t get out of my head. I got my CT today and the results were normal besides a cyst on my kidney?. Yet I find myself on google EVERY SINGLE TIME to ask questions and find out what can go wrong. For instance I found many story’s where people had pancreatic cancer and the CT missed it or was read incorrectly. My lower back has been bothering me a lot which is making me feel worse because I seen that’s a sign. Wouldn’t the drs have found something in the blood work or something!?

2018-07-17T18:42-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Sorry you are so very worried but take comfort in the response made by Po. Also if cancer it would not decrease in size but would steadily continue to grow. If you feel your physician is not explaining in terms you can understand it is up to you to insist on further explanation perhaps someone in the medical group such as a patient advocate if they have one. We fully understand the waiting and worry but your doctor is doung what is best in monitoring the situation.  Lung nodules are common especially as we age. Stay away from Googling lung nodules as Google is not a doctor does not know your medical history and tends to point a person to the worst case scenerio. Until your next follow up keep yourself busy . There is not much medically that can be done at the moment other than monitoring. If you feel you can not cope then discuss your fear with your doctor or seek a second opinion one with someone you have confidence with. Good luck to you and hoping the next scan will show little concern.  Lisa,http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/28375-my-mom,lisa1962

2018-07-18T12:21-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Thank you Lisa for the encouraging words I guess I just have to take one step at a time And boy I have been trying to keep busy I have painted and re done so many projects 🙂but my mind always seems to bring me here Its very unsettling feeling of the unknown And the Doctor with the first CT was giving me positive feedback but after the most recent CT his words the nodule is changing appearance I even said to him it got smaller that should be a positive sign And research for that one is leaving me confused the findings on CT were even though decreased in size demonstrates diffuse soft tissue density therefore not clearly improvedjust dont know how to take that It does help writing to all of you and getting it off my chest Thanks again for your response,null,Heather38
2018-07-18T03:40-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],We used to be comforted by the doctor's words. Radiologists are a different breed. If your insides do not exactly match Mr. or Mrs. Perfect on the wall chart in the doctor's office they make note of it in ominous sounding words. Never mind that they are observing bodily peculiarities that you have had since birth. They are also covering their hind quarters from law suits and tend to the paranoid so as to spur your PC to poke and prod you more.,null,po18guy
2018-07-18T05:11-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I'm sorry you're going through this prolonged period of uncertainty. As it seems that you'll require monitoring for a while yet until what's happening with the lung nodules becomes clearer I do think it's worthwhile communicating to your doctor that dismissive answers to your questions exacerbate the anxiety you're already feeling about not having answers. You need a doctor who makes you feel like a partner in your own healthcare and it doesn't sound like yours is doing that. Is it possible for you to get your GP to go through the findings with you or if your specialist works at an outpatient clinic is there a nurse educator or someone similar you could ask for clarification and guidance?,null,Sparkle Lolie
2018-07-16T07:39-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi there I came down with a sudden gastro related illness last year which was undiagnosed but was a functioning gastro disorder. That was last June initially I had a sudden bout of diaherria. Abdominal pain head foggyiness which has not mostly gone all that remains is bowel twitching bowel noises excessive beltching gas. I also had a problem with upper back pain which is still here and recently has stayed here for a month at a time. Its a pain between my shoulder blades which sometimes is remedied by heat cold cream but the pain can defer into other parts of my body too like neck shoulders legs arms. Ive had 3 chest x rays 4 blood tests colonoscopy endoscopy abdominal ultrasound last year. All came back clear. I dont get abdominal pain just a heavy feeling above belly button. Its been over a year now no other symptoms. I guess the upper back pain and belching has me concerned its pancreatic related its generally worse in the upon waking.,null,DS3

The one commonality of my symptoms are Lung Cancer with Superior Vena Cava Syndrome. I have been doing a LOT of reading and there is nothing very promising in fact quite the opposite. I am OK with this and will deal the card dealt.  Long time smoker... BUT.. The symptoms I do not have: Cough Shortness of breath fatigue and zero weight loss. Not grabbing at straws just surprised. I know we need an official diagnosis and i am not sure in Short Cell or Non-short cell makes a big difference. Ill post what they come up with next week.

2018-07-14T12:48-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hello Dane Sorry to hear of your worries however i have moved your thread to our Worried forum as that is the appropriate place to post without a diagnosis.  Based on your writings you have done a lot of research based on your symptoms and while we have information readily available in the cyber world i can say that Googling symptoms tends to not be the best idea as it will generally lead you to the worst case scenario.  For now stick with the guidance of an actual medically trained professional. If you have little confidence with your current physician seek another.  Hoping the concern seen on an xray assuming this is what prompted further investigation turns out to be far less sinister than a cancer diagnosis.  Keep us posted and let us know how the biopsy goes.  Lisa,http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/28375-my-mom,lisa1962

2018-07-11T20:56-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I was seen for a new small mole on the back of my shoulder. The dermatologist didn't want to take it off saying it looked fine but I asked him to. I know from experience biopsies take up to 5 days and medical assistants call with normal results. Today is day 11. I have been calling since day 5. Today the dr actually got on the phone to tell me they have preliminary results but the pathologist needs several more days to do more testing on the sample. I am so terrified and confused. I tried to ask the dr questions and he abruptly said "I can't tell you what you want to hear." I hung up in tears. He said he would call me back in two days.

2018-07-12T12:28-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],To be honest I'm not sure.

2018-07-11T06:31-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],To reiterate Your first action is to see the ENT doctor and take it from there not leaping head first onto a cancer support forum. Unfortunately it is all to easy with the volume of internet information to think or indeed convince oneself that cancer is the culprit. Yes the latest data suggests that 50% will be affected by cancer at some time in their life. This doesn’t mean 50% will get a cancer but will be “affected” by someone family or friends that are diagnosed. To Take my perspective I’ve had 1 type so far cured another they thought I had which I didn’t and living quite relaxed with another confirmed prostate cancer diagnosis. Easy no worried no anxiety no. Dealing with what life throws at me but refusing to be consumed by the pervasive one word “cancer” after all not every pain symptom is cancer. In other words live and enjoy life as life is far to short to feeling continually anxious. Anxiety destroys ones daily life and drastically alters our perspective. Go and see your doc and hopefully be reassured what you have is not what you think you have.

2018-07-10T22:15-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hello I am a 28 year old female and recently had some severe pain in my arm which led me here. I am not a big drinker but do drink at the most 1-2 times a week usually rum or vodka. Recently while drinking I have had severe forearm upper arm and shoulder pain. It was so bad I almost went to the ER or Med center because I thought I had torn a muscle or broke something. It was aching and throbbing so bad. When it happens it is extremely severe. So I did some research and read that it is something that people with lymphoma may experience as one of the first side effects (I know not to trust dr. google but I was desperate to figure it out). I know that alcohol can cause different issues with the body but this symptom I had was very severe.  Over the last few months I have also been experience shortness of breath (I do have asthma but this is more severe than ever) I can barely do anything without getting out of breath. I have had really bad body pains all over for what seems like no reason sometimes I am just in pain and I don't know why. I am also bruising on my breasts very easily. I also have recently had upper chest pain above my right breast. I am not sure if my lymph nodes are swollen or not but the lower part of my armpits do seem swollen but I haven't seen or felt any lumps or bumps in any lymph nodes so far. Also I have seen guides on how to check lymph nodes but I don't know if I am doing it right. I also have a random rash on my stomach and feel itchy in different places even though I have changed no soaps or anything like that. I haven't had any of the other known symptoms like fever or weight loss or sweating. I do want to go to the doctor and I know I should but I am very shy about going to the doctor and also my insurance isn't great and it costs me so much to do so. I am going to try to see the doctor this week and I am not coming here to ask someone to say I have cancer or anything like that. I just want some advice or some ideas of what is possibly going on with me.,null,sjd490
2018-07-11T12:19-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],We couldn't even guess at what is going on with you and it's entirely possible that your symptoms are unrelated to each other. A doctor's visit is the only way you're going to get an explanation but I doubt that any form of cancer will be in the top 10 possibilities they explore. It's extremely important that you get your asthma under control though. Go see your doctor about that and mention the other symptoms while you're there.,null,Sparkle Lolie
2018-07-11T12:42-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],That would be the weirdest lymphoma that I have ever heard of. STOP Googling and just go see doctor. What you have are symptoms.

2018-07-10T20:01-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Im 33 and Ive had blood in the toilet on and off for almost 2 years now. Immediately after it happened I went to the doctor. Ct scans blood work colonoscopy with biopsies endoscopy with biopsies x-rays a FOT and ultrasounds. Nothing. No answers. Labs have been slightly off (Neutrophils slightly elevated with regular WBC) Elevated sedimentation rate (34) Elevated C-reactive protein (.9) and yet I was told everything is normal. My symptoms are as follows... -Rectal bleeding every couple of months that lasts for a few days (I usually have diarrhea before I bleed) -A lot more gas and gas pain -Change in bathroom habits  -And recently Ive felt a bit tired My last labs were 10 months ago as well as a Ct with contrast. I have severe anxiety someone please help. Ive done everything Im supposed to do when you start having bleeding and not one answer has been found.

2018-07-10T20:28-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Cancer that is that far progressed that late stage; that widespread CANNOT hide. Especially not from the numerous tests which you have undergone. Bleeding from a tumor does not normally turn itself on and off. It starts then gets worse. Something would clearly show up somewhere.  It seems that anxiety is clearly leading you to suspect cancer when the evidence states most emphatically: No! 1. Treat your anxiety.  2. I would advise you to get a 2nd opinion but it seems that you have had a 3rd 4th and 5th. 3. Treat your anxiety.

2018-07-10T20:28-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Sorry your worry has brought you here. I have moved your thread to our worried forum as that is the place to post without a diagnosis.  Your doctor has ran multiple tests with no findings. Not sure what else can be done or what we can suggest. Perhaps a change in diet? Has your doctor ruled put IBS? If you have had these symptoms going on two years and it was cancer the likelihood of you even being here to post is remote. The only thing we can suggest is to get a handle on your anixiety so you do not jump to thoughts of cancer. If you have little faith in your doctor even though all necessary tests have been performed then you have to address why you feel they must be wrong. Keep a diary of your diet lifestyle and see if there are any triggers resulting in your symptoms.  I will also add that colon cancer while not unheard of is rare for your age so keep that in mind.

2018-07-07T08:32-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi all been lurking here for the last month thought Id post. Im a 25 year old male and about 5-6 weeks ago I discovered a small pea sized lump under my collarbone. You cant see it when Im just standing normal. However if I flex my neck or push slightly under my right middle clavicle (literally maybe 1 cm under clavicle) a lump slides up then slides back down. You can visually see it slide up on to the clavicle then when I relax it just slides back under. The lump is probably 0.6-1 cm big. I measured but its hard to hold lol. The day I discovered it I was hit with a ball in ball hockey pretty hard very very close to where the lump is. I also had a bad sunburn that weekend. And being a hypochondriac that I am I played around with the lump for the first few weeks I had it too. The lump hasnt gotten any bigger I thought it got smaller last week but Im not really sure. Its painless as well. Its not rock hard but not exactly soft either. Id say it can move an inch vertically and horizontally. I have a doctors appointment booked for this Tuesday. Of course my worst fear is lymphoma but I havent had any other symptoms. Last year I lost some weight when I was using Percocet but since being off them since November Ive probably gained 10-15 pounds. No night sweats been eating a lot no fatigue I wouldnt normally have. Ive gone from worrying straight for 3 weeks too relaxing about it for a couple and worrying again. The mind is a funny thing lol.  So long story short; 25 year old male with painless 0.6-1 cm rubbery lump under right clavicle about 3 inches from shoulder/arm joint. It moves above collarbone with pressure or flexing. Been there for 5-6 weeks without much size changes. Edit: also 5 days before I noticed it I had a random allergic reaction to a burrito that Ive never had lol. My arms got really blotchy no itching or anything just red spots all over. Was gone when I woke up so it Im assuming it was an allergy of some sort.,null,Chefbard

2018-07-06T14:17-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],My dad had a cough for a week and had an X-ray that showed pneumonia around a nodule. He was given antibiotics and the cough went 95% away. To be safe they did a CT scan and they stated they are unsure what it is and referred him to a pulmonologist. Some possibilities they gave him are an infection that caused pneumonia or an aspirated piece of food and then of course cancer.  I made the mistake of reading every single study I could find and from what I read a 30mm nodule in the upper right lung (which he has) is almost always cancer. Im clinging onto some hope though and was wondering if anyone had similar symptoms (pneumonia that went away w antibiotics and a similar size /location of nodule) that ended up as something other than cancer.  Any input would be great,null,Mmstevens18
2018-07-06T14:28-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi sorry your worries and research have brought you here perhaps you need to change your mind set to; until someone tells you its cancer your dad does not have cancer google is great at either creating serious illness or having you dead within 4 clicks. At present they rule everything in before the tests allow them to rule things out so be patient and wait to see what tests the doctors recommend and why so channel your energy to help your dad understand the pro's and con's of those tests and limit what you search for otherwise you just might make that 4 click mistake and get it totally wrong. Let the specialists do what they do best.

2018-07-06T16:33-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Radiologists tend to be rather alarmist - and not without reason. However lung nodules are very common. I would guess that every human who has ever lived has had them - the difference being that we now have the technology to see them. This of course raises all sort of issues which are premature until its nature and cause are known.  If the symptom was a cough and if it has nearly resolved that is good news. Many such situations are called "cancer scares" but why? Simply because someone used the word? Doctor's and radiologist's opinions do not determine reality. If there is no cancer there can be no cancer scare - only being scared. And that is fear of the unknown at this point. Your fear began when you Googled up a death sentence for him. You see why fear and concern should never determine reality or one's mental state? Rather let the doctors sort out just what it is - from the 68000+ different diseases known to mankind. Am guessing that about 67000 of them are not cancers.  This is also a wake-up call that our lives are finite and fragile. Today 102 people in the US will lose their lives suddenly in traffic collisions. No warning. No goodbyes. 37000 per year. So since you love your dad reaffirm that love and enjoy spending time with him each day that you can. The future is unknown and the truth is that we might exit this life before our parents do! Love him spend time with him and hope for the best.,07/08 Age 56 DX 1) Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma-Not Otherwise Specified.

2018-07-07T12:00-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],My fellow moderators are correct. Especially considering that your Dad just had pneumonia which is a common cause of these nodules please try to breathe and relax. Nodules can be caused by scarring infections (such as pneumonia) inflammation (even from arthritis) exposure to irritants or even benign fibrous tissues. So the best thing you can do is stop goggling (worst thing ever right now) and just help him follow up with his dr. That and as PO says live love and laugh together.

2018-07-06T18:32-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],So it all started a couple months ago I saw bright blood on my poo and on my toilet paper I was sure it was hemmeroids (sorry if I misspelt that) but I made a doctors appointment just to be sure. I did a urine test blood test and stool test and they were all perfect. I felt normal for about a month or so I workout regularly so since it started to warm up I started to do a lot more cardio to cut fat for summer since Id be spending more time outdoors at camps. I felt great went for jogs and worked out everyday at the gym. About 2 or 3 weeks ago I noticed that my appetite has been lacking. I couldnt eat half of what I could in the morning specifically I felt bloated for hours after eating but the symptoms went away as the day went on. This lasted for about a week or so then the symptoms went away for a week or so. The symptoms returned about a week or two ago seeming worse I cant go for complete bowel movements and I get bad pains everytime I eat accompanied with severe bloating and a feeling of food at the bottom of my throat. I havent worked out for the last 5 or 6 days because the pain and bloating from eating breakfast or dinner usually stops me from doing anything for 3-4 hours. Ive lost a lot of weight but I imagine it is from the minimal amount of food Ive been eating and the extreme workout routine and strict diet I had for the last month or so before the symptoms got this severe. About 5 days ago I did see blood in my poo again but this time it wasnt on the toilet paper. This alarmed me and the blood lasted a couple days. I paid a visit to the hospital 2 days ago and the blood and urine tests were pristine in the doctors words. He felt me all over and said he couldnt feel any abnormalities. I believe that I already have bad anxiety when it comes to worrying about health issues especially since my aunt was diagnosed with terminal cancer three years ago. I cant stop thinking that I have stomach or pancreatic cancer and its eating me up inside. My doctor called a specialist and Im awaiting a call for a colonoscopy but Im considering going to the hospital again and asking for a ct scan because the pain and gloating after eating is stopping me from enjoying my day as it is severe to a point where I dont want to do anything. What do you guys think? What should I do? Is it possible to have cancer with these symptoms even though all my tests were perfect? Im worried sick. Side note: in the past couple months Ive been drinking a lot more alcohol than usual I have been going to my friends camp 1-2 times a week and we always drink to a point we are drunk for sometimes all day long. Ive also started drinking protein shakes before the symptoms started to worsen. I drank about 3 a day which contained 30g of protein per serving. Im thinking maybe the excessive amount of protein I was consuming did something to me? Another thing I forgot to mention is that I usually feel alright at night and the symptoms often come during the day and start to dissipate as the day goes on,null,Dbaks
2018-07-06T18:47-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Sorry to hear you feel unwell but keep in mind we will not guess to the cause of your symptoms.  You have made significant changes to your eating habits and exercise routine. Can that cause your symptoms? Again we can not answer that question.  Your doctor is not concerned but you have allowed your health anixiety to convince you otherwise hence posting on a cancer site. It is unlikely walking into an ER and demanding a CT scan is unlikely they will perform such a test. Colon or pancreatic cancer is rare if not unheard at your age. Suggestion make another appointment with your physician explain how worried you are be honest about your diet and alcohol consumption and allow them determine the next course of action.

2018-07-06T12:16-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],After some symptoms have been popping up I finally decided to book a doctor appointment. The doctor mentioned a possible gallbladder or pancreas problem in the initial consult. I dont have bad pain though like pancreatitis is described to be. My symptoms never seemed to indicate a gallbladder issue either though. The dr caught me by surprise when he asked me if Ive ever had pancreatitis before which I havent. I dont have severe pain but rather an ache in my upper abdomen with unfortunately a bunch of other symptoms. They did the HIDA scan yesterday and told me the results show a borderline delayed biliary to bowel transit. Apparently there was a faint uptake at the 59 minute mark. She made it a point to say though the gallbladder looked normal otherwise. I called to get the results and the nurse read me the results and said the doctor will be in touch at some point tomorrow.  Are these results significant given the fact I have had this ache for quite some time and havent acted on it until now.  My wife seems uneasy about these results and Im starting to feel the same way. Shes been googling and is zoning in on pancreatic cancer given the fact the pain is not severe like pancreatitis. Could this HIDA scan be an indicator that this is perhaps pancreatic cancer?,null,Jroberto54
2018-07-06T05:53-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I would not ask Dr. Google to interpret the words you have been given over the phone. Of course everyone seems to zone in on the worst possible outcome. When you list “some symptoms” and ask “could this be...” the answer will almost always be “yes” no matter how unlikely.  Cancer patients have had every symptom you can imagine.

2018-07-04T12:44-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Good-evening First I want to express my gratitude for this forum. I have been worried sick over a recent visit to my Gastroenterologist that yielded some unexpected results.  I am a 35 year old male who started experiencing intense nausea bloating acid reflux and chest/back pain in November 2017. I was referred to GI where an endoscopy was performed with normal results. A follow up CT Scan was done with the following results: Best demonstrated on the axial and coronal reconstructions(axial image 40 coronal image 47) is a 1 cm rounded soft tissue density at the junction of the second and third portions of the duodenum near the expected location of the ampulla.  Impression: possible 1 cm polyp or mural nodule at the junction of the second and third portions of the duodenum near the expected location of the ampulla. My doctor said come back in 3-6 months for a follow up. At this point I thought nothing of it but at my six month follow up he said I had a benign adenomatous neoplasm. Of course I frantically researched on Google University and have seen how this is rare and could be malignant. I dont know what to think. My doc has scheduled a second endoscopy but said he is not worried: why am I? Can he really tell benign vs malignant from a CT Scan? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. My Best!,null,Troop82

2018-07-04T14:17-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Sorry your worry has brought you here. We can not even begin to guess but will say when you have a mole and you notice changes it is always best to have it checked out by a medically qualified physician. Make the appointment and try not to jump to thoughts of cancer. Stay busy until the appointment and refrain from googling as Google is very good at convincing even the most level headed person they are seriously ill.,http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/28375-my-mom,lisa1962
2018-07-05T03:37-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],As Lisa said we couldn't even begin to guess but it's important that you get it checked out by a doctor who does a lot of skin cancer checks. If you don't have access to such a doctor then make sure that your doctor puts a detailed description (including size) of the mole in your notes and get either him or someone else to photograph it. That way it will be easier to tell whether it's changed at all in the future.,null,Sparkle Lolie
2018-07-05T16:59-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],You didn't say what the time frame was for getting an appointment unfortunately. If it's a couple of weeks then I wouldn't be too concerned. If the delay is more than that you might consider going to one of those "Ready Care" type clinics to be examined. If the doctor there has any suspicion that your mole may be cancerous he'd be able to refer you to a specialist - which is pretty much the same thing that your regular doctor would do. And you could get that done within a day or so instead of waiting some interminable amount of time.,DX - 5/2010 Grade 1 Stage 4 fNHL - w/spleen and 47% bone marrow involvement TX - 6/2010-12/2010: SWOG S0801- R-CHOP + Bexxar + Rituxan (4 yrs/quarterly) Restaged (post Bexxar) - PCR-Neg/NED :2/2011  Rituxan maintenance ended 3/2015 1/2018: Remission continues (>7 years) Down to one checkup/year!,Defens
2018-07-02T14:40-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],My mom and myself are worried. Im 16 and have been experiencing the following symptoms: Hair thinning pelvic pain lower back pain Migraine head aches constant constipation and missed periods. I often will skip periods for two months at a time: Ive been keeping track and have only had 5 in the last 11 months (And I started at age 12 so I should be regular). We went to the doctor and I was diagnosed with PCOS: I was also told I have enlarged ovaries and a hormonal imbalance. However she only did basic blood tests and a full bladder ultrasound (Not transvaginal). She also told us that this condition could lead to other things such as endometrial and ovarian cancer Ive had symptoms for two years and she didnt test for anything except Thyroid problems and hormone imbalances. I was also diagnosed with chronic migraines three years ago and cant take birth control; as it causes adverse side effects when with my medication; Topamax. She says theres little I can do but take antinflamitories when the pelvic pain starts. Im now switching to a pediatric gynecologist and am hoping for better results. Any advice? Any comments? Do my symptoms match anyone with Ovarian or any other gynocological cancer (So we can determine if we need to press for tests)? Thank you for your time! (It also made me nervous that the X-ray tech kept asking if my doctor is doing blood tests; the tech was only getting the images and looking as she went and after she got a picture of my right ovary started asking about tests).,null,HelloKitty101
2018-07-02T16:41-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Trans vaginal Ultrasounds are usually only needed if clear view of everything has not been obtained so it is not always done. Is there any reason that you suspect cancer in spite of a clear scan? Your symptoms certainly fit PCOS and that is what has been seen so on the face of it there would be no reason to look for anything else. Cancer risk is increased in PCOS but it is still at the usual ages so unlikely to be an increased risk factor at the moment. You need to discuss your worries with your gynaecologist but from what you have written cancer is unlikely.,null,Lyssa

(It also made me nervous that the X-ray tech kept asking if my doctor is doing blood tests; the tech was only getting the images and looking as she went and after she got a picture of my right ovary started asking about tests).I'm a little concerned by your opening statement. If both you and your mother are concerned that the doctor has missed something it suggests that you both suffer from some degree of health anxiety and there's a good chance that you will feed each other's anxiety and doubt. PCOS is an annoying condition but it is not an uncommon one. Beyond monitoring with occasional ultrasounds there is really no treatment beyond symptom management (Metformin didn't turn out to be as useful as initially hoped)  although maintaining a healthy weight will definitely help minimise symptoms. It's possible that you may need assistance with falling pregnant in the future but that's far from a certainty. The number of follicles on your ovaries can and will change and that often includes some of them disappearing. Nothing you've mentioned suggests anything other than PCOS and you'll be getting your general gynecological well-being checked out on a regular basis from now on as part of monitoring the PCOS - giving you the best chance of early detection if other problems should arise in the future. For now make sure you maintain a healthy weight and diet make sure you have a plan for symptom relief which works (and if it doesn't then work with your doctor until you find one which does) and leave the worry about what may happen decades down the track to the experts.,null,HelloKitty101
2018-07-05T01:32-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],HelloKitty We take the stance here that other conditions should be ruled out first (unless extremely obvious) before going to a diagnosis of cancer. Follow through with your second opinion with the pediatric gynecologist. Remember they are the medical experts Dr. Google is not. Blood tests ultrasounds etc cannot confirm the presence of cancer. Only a biopsy can do that. If nothing is found take solace in that and rejoice! There are many conditions that females endure and survive just fine. With assistance from medical professionals they can be managed very well.

2018-05-31T07:02-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I am 19 years old up at 3AM freaking out about lymphoma. Have had a chain of swollen lymphnodes on both sides of my neck for months. Started out with HIV testing which gave a false positive result. All normal CBCs 1 had slightly elevated white blood cell count. An ENT described my nodes as "rubbery" and said he was "concerned" and mentioned lymphoma after my ct scan but that other diseases like mono can present the same way. Ive had often painful swollen glands on both sides for 4 months but 1 swelled a lot larger after i was diagnosed with strep a month ago but docs say they shouldve gone down with antibiotics. Pain shifts from left to right side. Other symptoms ive had include cough joint pain pain in my groin and stomach(almost like pulled muscles) change in bowel movements(i also have ibs stomach issues so it could also be that) chest pain and a painful sore throat trouble swallowing with chills that have all since gone away but chills started when i first noticed the swollen nodes. Lately ive been feeling better with the exception of joint pain... Ive gained weight fairly energetic but nodes are still very swollen. ENT said itd be risky to fully biopsy my biggest node as its close to my jugular but that a fine needle wouldnt be effective for checking for cancer. Should i be worried? Do the risky biopsy? Wait it out? What should I do?? Other health issues ive been diagnosed with include gluten sensitivity irritable bowel syndrome and schleroderma(an infectious disease doctor told me my symptoms dont resemble lymphoma but the false positive hiv test may indicate an auto immune disease). I have tested negative for strep b mono brain abnormalitis with MRI lupus/rheumatoid arthritis(showed inflammation) cmv lyme disease(false positive) HIV(false positive) oral STDs. Awaiting lab results for cat scratch fever and a more specific rheumatoid test. No history of cancer in family but auto immune diseases like b12 deficiency and lymphacitic colitis is present.  ~Anyone who can help give me info whether good or bad would be greatly appreciated. I know cancer is time sensitive and life threatening so i feel its risky to have my node removed and also risky not to check for cancer. I just dont know what else it could be and worrying has taken over my life. Docs cant understand why my symptoms get better then worse again why my nodes didnt respond to antibiotics but say lymphoma isnt usually with swollen nodes on both sides and i look healthy overall. I dont feel like im dying and couldn't imagine getting the diagnosis of cancer. My thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has been diagnosed,null,Nbenj16
2018-05-31T13:22-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hello- It sounds like you have a lot going on with your health right now including coming off your strep throat recently. While we are not doctors on this forum our advice is that leaping to a diagnosis of "cancer" is premature and usually only exacerbates anxiety. The only way you'll get a positive diagnosis is through a biopsy so you might continue to work with your ENT and ask them "despite the risk at what point do we consider going after a biopsy?" If not the largest node perhaps there's another they could biopsy away from the jugular vein? In any case you're doing the right thing working with your doctors as they have the best information and are clinically trained to assess your health history and make the correct diagnosis. If you feel you're not getting the best information from your ENT and your symptoms worsen you may want to consider a second opinion.

2018-05-31T14:36-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],The above advice is what we would all say and working with your medical team is the only way to get answers sometimes things have to be done to rule out diseases that may be the case with the biopsy as the scan would light up if it was showing a potential lymphoma. The scan would also show where the potential lymphoma may be and that leads them to the nodes to biopsy so is the other options and can a different node be taken as suggested by Indylou. The are lots of diseases that cause nodes to react so until someone does say its lymphoma then you don't have it and worrying won't change that to a positive or negative what will be will be and it may take many tests to get to that point. Hope you get some answers soon.

2018-05-31T21:14-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I was hoping that someone could tell me if my symptoms resemble a lymphoma or what my chances are. My nodes are often painful symptoms seem to worsen then better and the swelling is on both sides- the pain changes sides and I have pain and possible swollen nodes elsewhere in my body such as in my joints and groin no night sweats-- which makes me feel i have some good signs that its NOT cancer. But i dont know what else it could be that I havent already tested negative for. I just want something to put my mind at ease or something that will push me to doing the risky biopsy if i need to or if i should take another route completely or if someone can suggest other causes for persistent swollen nodes. Thank you for the advice. I have a needle biopsy tomorrow and will post results when i get them- whether good or bad. I wont just drop off the forums like some do when they get a diagnosis.,null,Nbenj16
2018-06-01T12:36-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Nbenj16- You'll find that there aren't a lot of regular users on this forum that will listen to a poster's list of symptoms and then immediately rush to diagnose it as  "oh yeah...that's a SURE sign of cancer!" It's not that we're not direct it's just that the body can only produce so many "symptoms" at one time and there are tens of thousands of different diseases. Symptoms overlap diseases and a medical professional must consider a patient's medical history the symptoms they present and even their professional judgment before making a diagnosis. As you know the lymphatic system is part of the body's immune system and many infections and diseases can trigger all kinds of responses there. It wouldn't be responsible for us to confirm that a symptom you describe as lymphoma or not. Because cancers are generally more rare I'd say the chances are that it could be something else. I would again emphasize that the best thing you can do is to continue working with your doctors to come to a diagnosis and treatment. We'd love to hear one way our another after you receive your diagnosis from biopsy.,Age 52 Male early Feb 2013 - Noticed almond-sized lump in shaving area right side of neck.

2018-06-01T17:03-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Honestly most of us here who actually have or have had lymphoma are not freaked out. Some never were. That alone should tell you about the power that worry asserts over your life. Our bodies are capable of producing about 150 different symptoms. But those symptoms are associated with over 68000 known illnesses and conditions - about 67000 of which are not cancer. So by the math and by your young age it is not likely to be cancer of any type.  Do also know that Google is a mortician and not not not a doctor. You have already found a death sentence in only a few clicks right? Fortunately not everything on the web is true or ever comes to pass in our lives. Being persistent with doctor believing doctor and taking doctor's advice can be huge. Soas Nike says "Just do it.",07/08 Age 56 DX 1) Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma-Not Otherwise Specified.

2018-07-01T04:35-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I was diagnosed with pneumonia 3 weeks ago. 3 days after that I had new sharp pain on the other side and went to the ER. I was found (CT w/contrast) to have four small Pulmonary Embolisms and a 4x1 cm mass in my lower left lung. I met with a pulmonologist while I was in the hospital and he said he is worried it's lung cancer but wanted to give the mass a chance to decrease in size if it is simply pneumonia. I smoked for 40 years so I'm not hopeful about that. Also I never really had pneumonia symptoms just the pain. The thing is I'm going nuts waiting out his 6 weeks until the PET scan. I think his intention in setting it so far out was to give me hope that it was just pneumonia.  Should I call and try to get the PET scan moved up?,null,suecris
2018-07-01T06:04-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Sorry to hear of your worry. I tend to agree that waiting 6 weeks seems rather long especially if the doctor is concerned.  Have you considered making an appointment with another specialist outside the one you saw in the hospital?  Normally a biopsy would be ordered as that is the only way to definitively diagnose the existence of cancer cells. This is a question you should asl the specialist. They may be ordering a PET to see if anything lights up before ordering the biopsy but still only a biopsy can offer the actual diagnosis.  Do keep us posted and let us know if you are successful in getting an earlier appointment.  Lisa,http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/28375-my-mom,lisa1962

I think his intention in setting it so far out was to give me hope that it was just pneumonia.  Should I call and try to get the PET scan moved up?It would be grossly irresponsible of any doctor to delay a test simply to give a patient a few more weeks of hope so it's really unlikely that is his reasoning. Can you remember his exact words and whether he said he's worried that it *is* lung cancer or that he's worried it *could be* lung cancer? They have different connotations in terms of how he's perceiving the likelihood. Is it possible for you to contact the doctor and talk to him about your concerns regarding waiting?,null,suecris
2018-07-02T15:34-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I just called his office about this and he's going out of town for the last two weeks in July. This may explain the delay I suppose. I was told I would have to wait even longer after the test for the results till he came back. I balked at that and they agreed to have one of his associates give me the results before his return. I guess I can wait three more weeks. I wonder if the fact that I had the pulmonary embolisms also factored into the delay - perhaps wanting me to get established on the blood thinners and wanting extra time to see if more have developed since then? No idea. I can't remember whether he said he was worried it was or worried it could be. I was kind of out of it. I remember he said "you've gotten my attention but there's a chance it's only pneumonia." That doesn't sound too promising frankly.  At this point it's only 3 more weeks and moving it up sounds like something they would resist. I'll wait. I don't want to become "That Patient" after all.

2018-07-03T08:51-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],The only symptom that sounds concerning is the fatigue but that can have dozens of causes. If a CD10+ B Cell was diagnostic of anything you would know it.

2018-07-03T09:04-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi Sorry your worry has brought you here. As I understand it the biopsy report says that the sample showed a normal cell population with a very small proportion of one specific clone - which could point either to lymphoma or to a reactive lymph node - and none the wiser at this point since the sample was too small for further study. You do not say how long it has been since you got those results but your doctor can probably tell you what is next based on his examination and your complete case history. If there is reasonable doubt that this may be lymphoma and s/he thinks it necessary to definitively rule out lymphoma then you will likely have to undergo an excisional biopsy so that the pathologist can have a look at the whole lymph node structure. Try to keep calm in the meantime as there is never any good reason for freaking out. Do keep us posted. PBL,null,PBL
2018-07-03T14:57-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Originally Posted by po18guyThe only symptom that sounds concerning is the fatigue but that can have dozens of causes. If a CD10+ B Cell was diagnostic of anything you would know it. The clear indicator here is that a complete node must come out. Not a big deal but a pathologist needs to examine an entire node for its internal structure.  Leukemia is easily detected via blood tests as it is a blood borne cancer.She ran a complete CBC along with other blood tests. Nothing came back abnormal.  The responses on this post set me at ease. The verbiage in the biopsy report just scared me as I have no previous knowledge about what cells are normal vs. abnormal. Doc says she thinks we will just follow up with a CT scan. She doesnt seem as concerned now that the labs are back.,null,po18guy

2015-08-05T16:17-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi I have had a lump on the back of my upper thigh for a few years (about half an inch / 1.5cm) but lately it has grown and changed.  When I went to the doctor with it in february it was 3-4 cm and underneath it was a bigger one (but not as protruding) of 5cm (2 inches). He sent me to an MRI where they said they could not determine what it was. It had a "diffuse T2 highsignal" and "not deep only in the subcutis possibly also epidermis". It has since then grown to 7cm in diameter. My doctor referred me to a plastic surgeon who is going to remove it and send samples too the hospital. My appointment is july 11th.  It really hasn't bothered me much I expect it to be a fat lump or something. However a friend of mine said that when they are bigger than two inches they shouldn't be cut into because it could be a sarcoma and the cutting by a plastic surgeon could make it spread. Googling it it seems she's right. My doctor is of course on holiday so I wonder if I should assume my doctor knows best and go ahead or contact somebody at the hospital (where I expect it will be impossible for them to give me a straight answer since they haven't been involved yet). What would you guys do? Suggestions?,null,zaphod
2015-08-05T16:49-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],When I first read what you said it didn't sound right to me but it looks like your friend is correct about sarcomas according to the MD Anderson website. The question is whether there is any chance it is a sarcoma. Has anyone said so? In your shoes I'd probably put in a call to the doctor who sent you to the plastic surgeon and discuss this concern with him/her and also look around for a second opinion.,null,GBMsibling
2015-08-05T18:12-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi zaphod and welcome though I am sorry you have reason to be here. I didn't see the reference to the risk of having this procedure done but probably just didn't look closely enough. I did see reference to the 4 standard types of biopsy and that all are useful tools in diagnosing soft tissue sarcomas. Is the surgeon removing the entire growth or doing a biopsy? If you are not sure that is a conversation you should have with your doctor.  It does seem that surgery is the treatment of choice for this type of tumoor according to the American Cancer Societry:The only way to cure a soft tissue sarcoma is to remove it with surgery so surgery is part of the treatment for all soft tissue sarcomas whenever possible. It is important that your surgeon and other doctors are experienced in the treatment of sarcomas. These are difficult tumors to treat and require both experience and expertise. Studies have shown that patients with sarcomas have better outcomes when they are treated at specialized cancer centers that have experience in sarcoma treatment. Please note that they also recommend that treatment should be at a specialized cancer center that specialize in this type of cancer. MD Anderson is one of those places so perhaps that is a conversation to have as well. I did see on the MDA site provided by GBMSibling that they would welcome your phone call so you might choose to give them a call to discuss things as well. I wish you well and good luck with everything you are dealing with do let us know how things go from here.

2015-08-05T20:21-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Kermica this was the bit that caught my attention on the MDA page; I took it to be the risk Zaphod's friend was referring to though I could be wrong: A biopsy that is not done correctly can cause the cancer to spread and make your treatment more difficult. It is best for the surgeon who does the biopsy to also remove the tumor.If so sounds like there's a risk involved if there's any reason to suspect that Zaphod's lump might be a sarcoma which is another question that needs to be asked of the doctors. (I was surprised to see that that was a risk for a sarcoma as I know it's not considered a risk e.g. of a brain biopsy; that being a myth we've occasionally encountered here.),null,GBMsibling
2015-08-05T21:00-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],According to the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group (SCG) (I am Norwegian) their guidelines are that all patients with tumors satisfying certain criterias shall be referred directly to the speciality sarcoma center without any prior surgery or invasive diagnostics due to the danger of metastasis through the blood. These criteria are: 1) All deep tumors regardless of size (immobile against musculature) 2) All subcutaneous tumors larger than 5cm 3) Tumors with other reasons of malignancy (pain growth lesions)  I have translated this from the following link: http://oncolex.no/Sarkom/Diagnoser/T...procedureGroup The fact that mine is larger than 5cm and has grown quite a bit lately I would satisfy criterium 2 and possibly 3 thus my doctor should have referred me to the sarcoma center. The MRI said they were unable to determine what it was except it was not a regular lipoma. My doctor is away for a vacation for two weeks so I was thinking maybe to contact the sarcoma center directly or go to another doctor and get a second opinion before I go through with the surgery next week.,null,zaphod
2015-08-05T22:44-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Yeah talking toit sounds like a good idea. It seems from all of this like it would definitely be better to delay the surgery until you've ascertained whether there's a possibility it's a sarcoma.,null,GBMsibling

2018-07-02T19:32-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],A long time since I posted this just remembered that I never posted back now that I got a new "lump". The first one turned out to be a malignant well differentiated liposarcoma. I got a bit worried but the doctors told me that they almost always come back the same place and rarely spread. By checking the edges of the tumor they could see that not all of it was removed. It was 15cm / 6 inches large. Much larger than it looked "from the outside" before they removed it. That was that they told me to keep an eye out for similar lumps and that there were no treatments they would advice as these kind of cancers don't respond well to chemo/radiation and removing more would involve cutting away muscles and nerves. I was given a business card and told to call them directly without referral if things changed. I haven't thought much about it until now. I now got another lump same place about an inch in diameter. My regular doctor thinks it's loose skin over where the tumor was removed because he can't feel any kind of lump when he touches it. But that it didn't "feel" like a lump was what they said the first time too... What would you do? Here's some technical info from the report when it was removed and analyzed (apologize for any mistakes I have translated it from Norwegian): Atypical liposarcoma not completely removed. cell and core variations with lipoblaster of different types. Clearly atypical which histolocigally points to well differentiated liposarcoma. PCR analysis: Increased amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 by quatitative PCR/qPCR. Amplification increase of MDM2 = 39.48 and CDK4 = 14.8 which is clearly elevated amplification of these genes.,null,zaphod

2018-07-03T13:42-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hello! My 72-year-old husband has follow up ct scans to monitor benign lung nodules. The most recent scan revealed no growth in the nodules but a 2 cm mass on his pancreas. He has none of the symptoms Ive found on websites. We are awaiting MRI results. Given the widely-disseminated information about pancreatic cancers poor prognosis however we are scared silly. Since members of this forum have firsthand knowledge of this cancer I would be grateful for whatever input you might share. Thank you!,null,GeorgeA
2018-07-03T15:19-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hello  Waiting for imaging results is nerve-racking and I am very sorry that you have to be in this situation. The presence of a mass on the pancreas is a reason of concern but we usually recommend to refrain from imagining the worse until the results are received. Even when you get the MRI results doctors will probably request a biopsy which is the only way to confirm the presence of pancreatic cancer.  You mentioned scans what types of scans are you referring to? When we reach a certain age lung nodules are common and are often benign. If they are stable this is a good sign. Were there other symptoms that led your doctor to request the scans?  I'm moving your post to the "Worried about Possible Cancer" section as there is no confirmed cancer but let us know the results when you have them. We'll be watching and will answer your questions as best as we can.  A final note: if you see any pancreatic cancer statistics please don't jump quickly to conclusions. The 5-year survival rate is by definition old statistics. We've seen better treatment protocols and advances in surgical procedures in the very recent years. I believe that pancreatic cancer is no longer a systematic death sentence. We are many to prove it. What is crucial for better health outcomes is to be referred to a multidisciplinary medical team with an expertise in pancreatic cancer and access to cutting-edge treatments in a high-volume academic hospital.,__________________________________________________ ___________________ 1/12/2016 No symptoms except ongoing fatigue; blood test revealed elevated liver enzymes 1/18/2016 Liver ultrasound then MRI confirmed enlarged bile duct  1/21/2016 ERCP and placement of a temporary stent 1/28/2016 CT-Scan showed a lesion on the head of pancreas 2/09/2016 2nd ERCP + EUS + FNA 2/12/2016 DX Borderline resectable pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma - Stage 3 @ 61 2/24/2016 FOLFIRINOX 3 cycles (6 infusions) 5/12/2016 CYBER-KNIFE Stereotactic Radiation 3 sessions 6/16/2016 WHIPPLE + portal vein and right hepatic artery reconstructions - 0/19 nodes pos - no mets.

2018-07-01T03:51-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi I know all of you would rather not hear a worry of cancer because you have already had to deal with it or have it but I really need some advice as I dont have anyone to direct me other than laugh at me for my worries. 4 months ago I noticed i was getting red flat areas of skin that were hot red burning occasionally itchy .  These marks would appear on my leg arms shoulder anywhere. I didnt think anything of it at first but it had gotten so annoying I felt my armpit one day and... theres a lump! . Ive felt my auxiliary lymph nodes before which were always tiny and pea sized but this time it was the size of two marbles. I was concerned and went to the doctor  got some antibiotics. The antibiotics did not work the  rashes  didnt go away and nether did the lump which she said would go with the use of doxycycline. Over the past couple months it had gotten bigger. Now apart of the lump is rock hard but the rest feels deep in my arm and fairly attached .  I had a full cbc a thyroid panel  rheumatic c protein  ana  everything normal except very low alkaline phosphate and signs of anemia. The doctor seemed stumped and sat pondering what it could be judging I have no allergies no family history of anything and no sickness she told me it might be a virus but most likely in end stages hopefully. That was it just a possible virus maybe ... still suffering w a hot face constantly pains in my stomach randomly massive headaches every other day red hot ears a severely itchy scalp and neck NOT TO MENTION THE SHARP CHEST PAINS I tried medicated shampoo didnt work . Since that appointment I now have a swollen occipital node on the right side still itchy scalp  still red rashes  and still the hot face and bright red ears lump in auxiliary . I am so frustrated and confused I know dr google is not very helpful and I will not worry myself with it but I am honestly worried about lymphoma and want it Rulled out. Although Im young and its unlikely it does happen  and most things have been rulled out. I had mono years ago which makes those susceptible to lymphoma which is concering . So sorry for rambling on but I truly have no one to turn to  anyone relate to these symptoms might possibly have an idea ? what doctor should I go see and what actions should I take. PLEASE read this and give me some insight . Thank you,null,Miaa2
2018-07-01T05:26-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],First you are doing the right thing by seeing appropriate doctors and having them try to find a diagnosis. Some conditions can be very difficult to diagnose so try to be patient though no know that can be difficult. to be honest your condition sounds more like autoimmune rather than lymphoma. If a doctor believes that there's a valid concern for lymphoma they'll order a biopsy which is the only definative way to diagnose lymphoma. The fact that a biopsy hasn't yet been ordered indicates to me that it's not yet being considered.,DX - 5/2010 Grade 1 Stage 4 fNHL - w/spleen and 47% bone marrow involvement TX - 6/2010-12/2010: SWOG S0801- R-CHOP + Bexxar + Rituxan (4 yrs/quarterly) Restaged (post Bexxar) - PCR-Neg/NED :2/2011  Rituxan maintenance ended 3/2015 1/2018: Remission continues (>7 years) Down to one checkup/year!,Defens

2018-07-02T15:04-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi Miaa2! We have completely different symptoms but Im a 16 year old who is also concerned about possible cancer; as my doctor was NOT thorough with testing and diagnosed me with a condition (PCOS) And has NO treatment/symptom management plan at all.

2018-07-02T17:45-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],The thing to remember is that we are not either healthy or cancerous. There are officially 68069 known diseases and conditions. Am guessing that about 1000 of those are cancers and sub-types. Yet our bodies can produce only 150 different symptoms. By simple math that is over 450 potential diseases per symptom. Thus you can see why diagnosis is so difficult. We report symptoms but as is seen those may not be all that helpful. Doctor looks for signs which are physical evidence of a disease process. Also you might note that some symptoms got worse after you went online. That can be our body's response to what we believe is bad news.  Some diseases resist diagnosis as they mimic numerous other conditions. At your age any cancer is exceedingly rare. I originally thought of a viral cause. It may also be autoimmune. Also antibiotics are very limited and cannot touch all types of bacterial infections. They do absolutely nothing to viral or fungal infections.  Lymph nodes enlarging on only evidence that your immune system has been activated either causing an inflammatory response or fighting a virus bacteria or fungus.

2018-06-15T21:29-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi everyone. I have been having a ton of symptoms that seem like I have pancreatic cancer. I went for a second opinion and the GI doctor agreed that my symptoms seem very indicative of pancreatic cancer but he said he cant order further testing since an ultrasound and a ct scan came back normal. The ct scan was a spiral ct and I had an oral drink as well as an IV contrast. My Gi doctor is saying this is a very good test especially given the fact I had the drink and the iv contrast. He said it would pick up a 1cm tumor. What has been your experience and do you agree with this?,null,Tee210

2018-06-16T12:29-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],I moved your post to the Worried forum since you do not have a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. We try not to get our diagnosed forum members caught up in the (many) people who are having symptoms without a diagnosis. An ultrasound by itself is poor at diagnosing pancreatic cancer. Ultrasound waves cannot see through air pockets and the pancreas is behind the intestines which often have air in them. A CT scan using a pancreas protocol is very good at seeing pancreatic tumors. It is what most of us have to monitor the tumor size. It uses thinner slices and specific timing of scans after the injection of the IV contrast to help highlight the area around the tumor. A regular CT scan can also see a tumor but it will need to be larger. My tumor was missed with a regular CT scan at 2cm in size and then seen at 2.3cm in size with a 2nd regular CT scan a few weeks later. You might ask your GI which type of scan you had. Specifically was it a CT scan using a pancreas protocol? Did the GI come to some sort of diagnosis? If not what are his plans for you? Another excellent diagnostic tool is the endoscopic ultrasound. This gives an excellent view of the pancreas but may also be justified because it can look for other problems if he has no diagnosis yet.,BRCA2 3398del5 Dec 2010 - back/abd pain May 2011 - Unresectable stage III 2.5cm tumor Jun-Aug 2011 - Gem/Cis 9 rounds Oct-Nov 2011 - Radiation+Xeloda 25 days in 5 weeks Oct 2011-Sep 2012 - shrinking tumor Feb 2012 - National Familial Pancreatic Study Aug 2012 - Downgraded to stage IIA PGP Sep 2012 - Whipple T3N0M0 0.5cm tumor 0/16 lymph nodes Dec 2012 - Quebec PanCan Study Sep 2012-May 2018 - NED Mar 2013-present - NCT01088789 @pancanology,ddessert
2018-06-16T07:59-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi everyone. I just want to say Im new to this community and Im blown away by the support you all offer each other...its amazing. A few short months ago I started to show many signs of pancreatic cancer however so far no diagnostic test has confirmed it. I got a abdominal and pelvis spiral ct pretty early on with oral solution as well as iv contrast. Although my dr has a hunch this is P.C. he is saying a CT of this kind is extremely effective in diagnosing pancreatic tumors. He also said it would identify any mass larger then 1 cm. Does anyone have any insight that they can offer about spiral ct with oral and iv solution as a diagnostic tool? Is it super effective? Any thoughts where I should go from here? Ive also had s HIDAS scan and an abdominal ultrasound which from my understanding doesnt help at all in P.C. diagnosis. Thank you all in advance.,null,Tee210

2018-06-16T09:11-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Thank you so much for all this information. My CT did not have pancreas protocol. Can any CT machine do a CT with pancreas protocol? If I request it would it need to be done at a special place That specifically offers Ct with pancreas protocol. The Dr is saying his opinion at this time is mild inflammation of the pancreas from drinking alcohol. My blood levels are all Normal though and Ive never had severe pain. My pain is very localized in one spot and when I drink alcohol it burns in that one spot. The dr thinks if I lay off the alcohol for a few months then everything may resolve and if not hell do further testing then. I do not really agree with this.,null,Tee210

2018-06-16T18:13-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],All CT scans for the last 20 years have been on spiral (aka helical) CT scan machines.  From what I’m told any CT scan machine can do the pancreas protocol. It is just a matter of how slowly they move you through the machine (to make thinner slices) and the timing of when they do a scan after injecting you with contrast dye. They do a pass before injecting any dye. Then they inject the dye and do another pass at 45? Seconds or so to highlight the major blood vessels that are carrying the dye throughout your body. Then another pass at 120? Seconds to let the dye infiltrate your organs including the pancreas. As a tumor does not easily get blood it stays dark in the scans while the healthy tissues are highlighted.  If you wanted to look at different organs the timings may be different. The problem is that for an undiagnosed person like you the doctor does not know which organ might be causing your problems. So to set up the scan to look in detail at the pancreas they might miss the more likely problem areas like the intestines gallbladder stomach or liver. The doctor’s orders for the CT scan should say something about pancreas protocol and probably the radiologist report.,BRCA2 3398del5 Dec 2010 - back/abd pain May 2011 - Unresectable stage III 2.5cm tumor Jun-Aug 2011 - Gem/Cis 9 rounds Oct-Nov 2011 - Radiation+Xeloda 25 days in 5 weeks Oct 2011-Sep 2012 - shrinking tumor Feb 2012 - National Familial Pancreatic Study Aug 2012 - Downgraded to stage IIA PGP Sep 2012 - Whipple T3N0M0 0.5cm tumor 0/16 lymph nodes Dec 2012 - Quebec PanCan Study Sep 2012-May 2018 - NED Mar 2013-present - NCT01088789 @pancanology,ddessert

My symptoms include rapid weight loss....more than 10 pounds within a months time extreme fatigue & weakness constant headaches everyday fevers everyday loss of appetite when I eat I get full really fast I have also been having chest tightness extreme dizziness everything goes black & my heart races to the point I almost pass out. My doctor has done blood tests & urine tests. My first blood test came back with a 12.6 white blood cell count elevated protein levels in my urine & blood in my urine. Then my doctor had me do a CT scan of the abdomin & pelvis with drinking contrast & IV contrast. That came back "normal" Now this coming Monday I have to call radiology & make another appointment to have a CT scan of my chest. I'm very frustrated cause I just want some answers as to what is going on with me! I'm not usually like this. I used to be a ball full of energy & was able to keep my apartment clean was active with my girls was active in my community. But now I can't hardly do anything! I feel as if I've had the life sucked out of me! I just wanna be back to my normal self again!

2018-07-02T08:11-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Sorry to hear of this. Leukemia especially that which was producing such noticeable symptoms would be easily detectable in the blood. You would bruise easily. Lymphoma would not normally produce such obvious symptoms without being easily detected. With over 68000 known human illnesses and conditions it might take some time to narrow this down. The 150 symptoms that we can produce are involved in those 68000 so symptoms are not all that useful for diagnosis. Doctor looks for signs - physical evidence of a disease process.

2018-06-30T20:52-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Hi all. 33 year old male here. I am a bit worried and I am sorry to unload all this on people who are already dealing with a lot. About 2 months ago I noticed a hard mobile moveable painless lump on my inner arm just above the point on my inner elbow. It was about 2 cm. At that time I also noticed a bug bite on the back of my arm above my elbow. The bug bite was raised and over the next 2 days it get really swollen and my skin was very red and spreading. Dr gave me some cefalexin antibiotics for the infection and it went away after a 7 day treatment of the antibiotics. The ball in my arm reduced in swelling to about 1 cm. I of course googled the area and it turns out you have epitrochlear lymph nodes there. It is in the exact spot as the diagram. In the space between bicep and triceps. I went feeling the other side and sure enough here is another mass in that arm too in the same spot. I freaked out a bit and wen to the dr. Who felt them and said it was nothing. So I went on my way.  Flash forward to a couple nights ago and I decided to feel in my armpits for any lumps in there. Sure enough each armpit has a large node right in the center of the armpit. If you put your fingers in the center of armpit and let arm relax down to your side and push your fingers against the chest wall you can feel a decent size lump that moves around. I also noted a couple other smaller lumps near the side of the pectoral muscle in each armpit too. I would say the biggest feels around 2 cm or more.  I have had some lymph nodes in my neck for 10 years or more that used to sacre me bit the drs all said they were fine after a ct scan. I remember checking armpits back then and didnt feel anything then. I am really worried that this could be a lymphoma of some type. The lumps are painless and pretty decent size. I have been feeling kinda run down lately and can sleep for 8 hours and still feel like I have not a lot of energy.  I had an ANA test done a few months ago and I was in normal range. This was given to me because of splinter hemorraghes I was getting in my nails(these have went away). Just not sure what else it could besides the big C word since my ANA was negative a bit ago.  Sorry for dumping my worries here. I dont want to upset my wife with my concerns. I will be making a dr appointment for this but just cant help but think the worst.,null,GJerry

2018-06-30T22:22-07:00[America/Los_Angeles],Thanks. I am trying to stay away from google but it can be difficult at times. I know it could be anything but it is hard to not go down the wrong road mentally.  I had a bad experience with a routine surgery that went south a decade ago. Since then I realized that things can bad for me too not just other people. I know that sounds odd but you always feel invincible until you are not. I appreciate you taking the time to resp
